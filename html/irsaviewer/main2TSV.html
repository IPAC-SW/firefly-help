<h2>Time Series Tool: Main Screen, Viewer (After Period Finding)</h2>


Now you are back to the main screen, with settings, tables (now more
than one), plot, and images.

<h3><A NAME="settings">Settings</A></h3>

The settings shown in this pane reflect the earlier choices you made,
in the <a href="main1TSV.html#settings">Viewer (initial screen)</A>.
Make changes here if you want to work with another band.<P>

Note that if you have done calculations on, say, WISE-1, and change
the dependent column to WISE-2, the plot on the right will phase fold
the WISE-2 data to the period you have selected from the WISE-1
analysis.<P>

<h3><A NAME="tables">Tables</A></h3>

Now the pane with the data table has two tables displayed. The time
series you have uploaded into the tool is one tab (as in the <a
href="main1TSV.html#table">Viewer (initial screen)</A>), and the other tab is
the phase folded time series (based on the P you selected in <a
href="findpTSV.html">period finding</A>). <P>

The phase-folded table comes up, by default, in the foreground, and sorted
by phase. The <a href="#images">images at the bottom</A> are also
sorted by phase.<P>


<h3><A NAME="plot">Plot</A></h3>

On the upper right, instead of the input light curve you have loaded
into the tool (dependent variable against time) as you had <a
href="main1TSV.html#plot">originally</A>, now it is the phased time
series.<P>

Note that if you have done calculations on, say, WISE-1, and change
the dependent column to WISE-2 in the settings pane on the left, the
plot will phase fold the WISE-2 data to the period you have selected
from the WISE-1 analysis.<P>


<h3><A NAME="images">Images</A></h3>

If you have been working with a WISE time series, just as you had <a
href="main1TSV.html#images">originally</A>,  on the bottom of the
screen there is a set of 5 images.  Because the <a
href="#table">table</A> in the foreground is the phase-folded time
series, with the table sorted in order of phase, the images are now
also sorted in order of phase.<P>


<strong>Everything is still dynamically linked.</strong> Click on a
row of the table, and the images (and plot) change; click on a point
in the plot, and images (and table) change.<P>
