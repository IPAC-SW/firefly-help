<h2>IRSA Viewer: Overview</h2>

The IRSA Viewer allows image visualization and catalog overlays, from
off your local disk, the web, and/or other IRSA services. It is a
standalone version of the image viewer portion of several other
archives housed at IPAC, such as <a
href="https://sha.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/"
target="_blank">SHA< <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10">/A>, <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/wise/"
target="_blank">WISE <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, and <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/planck/"
target="_blank">Planck <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, but portions can also be found in other
standalone tools. <P>

You can initiate the IRSA Viewer by loading the tool directly from the
IRSA Viewer button on the front page, or by clicking on a link in a
list of search results that looks like this: <img
src="img/viewerlaunch.png">. If  you have loaded the tool directly,
the first time you see the IRSA Viewer, it does not have an image
pre-loaded; if you have clicked the icon to launch it, the first time
you see the IRSA Viewer, it already has an image loaded.<P>

Besides the online help (also available as a pdf; see link at top
right), note that there are also IRSA Viewer Tool and Catalog Search
Tool video tutorials, including  quick start and longer AAS-demo-style
overviews, available at the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  Also see the IRSA Viewer
playlist (which collects all the IRSA Viewer tutorials together), as
well as the playlist of tutorials relevant for more than one
archive.<P>

<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>

The words in blue rectangles at the top are 'tabs.'<br>
<img src="img/bluetabs.png"><P>

This (or something like it) is the <b>image toolbox</b>:<br> <img
src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br> The contents and location of
the image toolbox can change depending on what images you have loaded
and/or selected.  In IRSA Viewer, an image toolbox is always present
as a row of tools just under the IRSA banner.<P>

Regardless of what tool you use, if you have just images loaded, you
may have these icons above the images:<img src="img/imagetiles3.png">.
The default is the middle icon, many images displayed at once, or the
"tiled view." To see one image at a time, click on the first icon, the
single square.<P>

Regardless of what tool you use, if you have images and catalogs
loaded, your browser window is divided into "panes", like "window
panes." The contents of the panes depends on what you are doing with
the tool, but could include an image pane, a catalog pane, and a plot
pane.  You can expand any of the window panes by clicking on the
expand icon: <img src="img/expand-24x24.png"> <p>

When you add things to the image as seen in your browser, you are
adding 'layers' to your image. You can turn the various layers off and
on via the layers icon <img src="img/layers.png"> in the image toolbox
-- the circled number tells you how many layers are displayed for the
image you have shown or selected.<P>



<h3><A NAME="visualization">Visualization Overview</A></h3>

When you load in images from your local disk, from the web, or from
the IRSA archives, you are interacting with the actual FITS file, and
as such, you can perform several manipulations such as changing the
stretch and color table, overlay things such as coordinates and
catalogs, and interact with the layers you have placed over the image,
such as identifying which source in the image corresponds to which row
in the catalog. You can also make plots of columns in the catalogs you
have loaded.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the Visualization section</A> for more
on visualization  and the <a href="catalogs.html">the Catalogs
section</A> for more on catalogs.<P>


<h3><a name="login">User Login</A></h3>

In the far upper right, there is a link to log in.  IRSA Viewer can
remember you when you return.  See the <a href="user.html">user
registration section</A> for more information.  <P>
