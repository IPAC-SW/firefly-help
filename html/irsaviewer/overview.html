<h2>IRSA Viewer: Overview</h2>

The IRSA Viewer allows image visualization and catalog overlays, from
off your local disk, the web, and/or other IRSA services. <P>

You can initiate the IRSA Viewer by loading the tool directly from the
IRSA Viewer button on the front page, or by clicking on a link in a
list of search results that looks like this: <img
src="img/viewerlaunch.png">. If you have loaded the tool directly,
the first time you see the IRSA Viewer, it does not have an image
pre-loaded; if you have clicked the icon to launch it, the first time
you see the IRSA Viewer, it already has an image loaded.<P>

Besides the online help (also available as a pdf; see link at top
right), note that there are also video tutorials, including quick
start and longer AAS-demo-style overviews, available at the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>.  Also see the IRSA Viewer playlists (one of which
collects all the IRSA Viewer tutorials together), as well as the
playlist of tutorials relevant for more than one archive.<P>

<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>

The words in blue rectangles at the top are 'tabs.'<br>
<img src="img/bluetabs.png"><P>

This (or something like it) is the <b>image toolbox</b>:<br> <img
src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br> The contents and location of
the image toolbox can change depending on what images you have loaded
and/or selected.  In IRSA Viewer, an image toolbox is always present
as a row of tools just under the IRSA banner.<P>

When you have images and catalogs loaded, your browser window is
divided into "panes", like "window panes." The contents of the panes
depends on what you are doing with the tool, but could include an
image pane, a catalog pane, and a plot pane.  You can expand any of
the window panes by clicking on the expand icon: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png"> <p>

When you add things to the image as seen in your browser, you are
adding 'layers' to your image. You can turn the various layers off and
on via the layers icon <img src="img/layers.png"> in the image toolbox
-- the circled number tells you how many layers are displayed for the
image you have shown or selected.<P>



<h3><A NAME="tools">Tools Overview</A></h3>

You can load in images from your local disk, from the web, or from
the IRSA archives. <a href="visualization.html">The Visualization section</A> covers basics of image manipulation. <P>

The <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> covers basic table manipulations; the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A> covers aspects of the tool specific to catalogs, such as overlaying catalogs on images. <P>

The <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A> covers plots from catalogs you have loaded in.<P>

The images, catalogs, and plots are all interlinked such that clicking on one point in the plot highlights the same point in the catalog and the image.<P>


<h3><a name="login">User Login</A></h3>

In the far upper right, there is a link to log in.  IRSA Viewer can
remember you when you return.  See the <a href="user.html">user
registration section</A> for more information.  <P>

<h3><A NAME="help">Getting More Help</A></h3>

The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. There are also
context-sensitive help markers throughout the tools (<img
src="img/help.png">).  You can also download a PDF version of this
manual; look at the top of the help window. (The PDF may be easier to
search than the web pages; use your PDF reader's search function.) <P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk/"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

<a name="bugs"></A><strong>Found a bug?</strong> The known bugs and
issues in this version of the IRSA Viewer are listed <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/irsaviewerbugslist.html"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  If you think you have found a bug, before
reporting it, please check this list, and read this online IRSA Viewer
help. It may be a "feature" we already know about.  If you have found
a new, real bug, then please do contact us via the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"

system version and your browser software and version.  If you can,
please also include any specific error message you may have gotten.
(NB: In our testing, copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux;
the command-C did not work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the
right mouse button did.)<P>
