<h2>IRSA Viewer: Catalogs</h2>

Catalogs are a special case of <a href="tables.html">tables</A>; the
basic functionality of tables is covered in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>.  You can choose from any of a
wide variety of catalogs to load for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. If you don't have an
image loaded, and you search on a catalog, the tool will pick an image
for you and overlay the catalog on that image. Once you've loaded a
catalog, you can <a href="plots.html">make plots</A>. <P>

<h3><a name="irsacatalogs"><a name="catalogs">IRSA Catalogs</A></A></h3>

By clicking on the blue "Catalog" tab (which also looks like a
button), a window appears with several options, as follows.  <P>

<img src="img/catalogsearch.png" width="100%"><P>

The upper left of this window is where you specify which catalog you
want to search.  To change catalogs, first select the "project" under
which they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS, WISE, MSX, etc. 
The available choices under the "category" and the specific clickable
catalog change according to the project you have selected.  A short
description is provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more
information (including definitions of the sometimes cryptic column
names); an example is here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

The upper right of this window is where you specify the target (the
position is pre-filled with its best guess as to what you want) and
the search method (cone, elliptical, box, polygon, multi-object,
all-sky), and the parameters that go with that search method (e.g.,
the radius of the cone). The parameters for each of these searches
change dynamically as you select search options, as follows:  <P>

<DL>
<DT><strong>Caution</strong>: <DD>Pick your units from the pulldown
first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select
from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to
the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. Note that these limits are survey-dependent.   <P>

<DT><strong>Cone search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-cone.png"><br> It has guessed what position you want,
based on prior searches. You specify the cone radius.<P>

<DT><strong>Elliptical search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-ellip.png"><br> It has guessed what position you want,
based on prior searches. You specify the search ellipse's semi-major
axis, position ratio, and axial ratio.<P>

<DT><strong>Box search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-box.png"><br> It has guessed what position you want,
based on prior searches. You specify the box's length on a side.<P>

<DT><strong>Polygon search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-polygon.png"><br> Now, note that it no longer has a
single target location. It has pre-filled the vertices of the position it
thinks you want, based on prior searches.  You can select whether you
want the catalog request to match the entire area of the image you
have selected ("image"), or just the portion of the image you can see
in the current view ("visible"), or your own ("custom") area. The list
of vertices in the coordinates box are in decimal RA and Dec in
degrees. You must enter at least 3 and at most 15 vertices, separated
by a comma. Note that, for overlaying catalogs on HiPS images, you
cannot select "image", because HiPS images are generally very, very
large, so this would result in too many points being returned. There
is a maximum of 5 degrees imposed on catalog searches to match HiPS
images.<P>

<DT><strong>Multi-Object search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-multiobj.png"><br> In this case, it has not
attempted to guess what position you want. You need to upload a file
in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a varietal of plain text. (IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table validator <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> which may be helpful.) Note that you also have to
specify the radius over which to search for each of the targets in
your list.<P>

When you do a multi-position search on catalogs, three new columns are
added to the catalog as it is returned to you. These columns are :
<UL>
<LI>cntr_01 - the target position you requested
<LI>dist_x - the distance between the target position you requested
and the object it found
<LI>pang_x - the position angle between the target position you requested
and the object it found
</UL>
These additional columns can help you assess if the target it found is
the target that should be matched to the position you requested.<P>


<DT><strong>All-sky search</strong>: <dd> <img
src="img/catsearch-allsky.png"> Because this is an all-sky search, it
does not have a single target entry box. In order to constrain this
search, you need to impose constraints on the bottom of the screen
(see below). <P>

</dl>

The bottom of this window allows you to set restrictions on specific
columns. It gives you a list of all the available column names in the
corresponding catalog. (Most catalogs have identical "standard" and
"long form" but some have more columns available in "long form".) From
here, you can choose what to display (tickboxes on the left), and
filter what is returned ("constraints" column). For
example, only return objects with values in column y that are greater
than x. If you add more than one restriction, they are combined
logically using an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus
restrict data such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. It will load the catalog
into a tab of its own. The objects will also be overlaid on any images
you have loaded, and a default x-y plot will be shown. (For more on the
x-y plots, see <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A>.)  All of these
representations are interlinked -- clicking on a row in the table
shows it on the image and in the plot, and clicking on an object in
the image shows it in the table and in the plot, and clicking on an
object in the plot shows it in the table and on the image.<P>

To close the catalog search window without searching for a catalog,
click on "Cancel".<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting.</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>If the catalog search is successful quickly, it will promptly return
the results in a tab of its own. 

<LI>The search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened, but be patient and eventually it will 
return a tab.

<LI>Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer. Searches that retrieve tens of thousands of rows
will take quite a while. 

<LI>If you want to impose additional constraints on the catalog during
your initial search, you can do so in the lower half of the screen
(e.g., SNR &gt; n in some band, or an SQL command), you can place
constraints at this point. However, be advised that it is easy to
combine constraints such that no sources are retrieved!

<LI> If you overlay a large catalog, then turn around and <a
href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">save a regions file from
the catalog overlay</A>, then currently it is the case that only the
first 499 sources in the full catalog will be saved to the regions
file.

<LI>If you have "pan by table row" turned on (see <a
href="visualization.html#panbytablerow">Visualization chapter</A>),
then it may be disconcerting to have the images "jump" right after the
catalog loads. It is centering the selected catalog object (the first
one upon catalog loading) in the viewer. If you don't like this, turn
off "pan by table row".

</ul><P>



<h3><a name="owncatalogs">Loading your own catalogs</A></h3><P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the top, "Load Catalog", to load your own
catalog, either from disk or from the <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>.<P>


Your catalog needs to be in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a varietal of plain text. IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table reformatting and validation service <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> which may be helpful, or you
can download just about any catalog you find through IRSA, and mimic
that format.<P>

Your table file MUST have RA and Dec values, and unless it is
specified, it assumes J2000.<P>

You can add a "SYMBOL" parameter to change the shape
(X, SQUARE, CROSS, EMP_CROSS, DIAMOND, DOT) of catalog marks, e.g.:
<pre>
\SYMBOL = X
</pre>
<P>

You can add a "DEFAULT_COLOR" parameter to assign a CSS color name or
a HEX value to catalog marks, e.g., either of these two:
<pre>
\DEFAULT_COLOR = lightcyan
\DEFAULT_COLOR = #00FF00
</pre>
You can find the <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color code or the CSS color HEX values <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> online.<P> 


<h3><A name="vocatalogs">VO Catalogs</A> -- Overlaying
catalogs obtained via the VO</h3>

(VO= <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Virtual
Observatory <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the center right, "VO Catalog", to search for
and load  catalogs from the VO.<P>

<br><img src="img/vocatalogs.png" width="100%"><br>
<P>

As for the IRSA catalog search, the tool pre-fills the target position
with the coordinates of the target with which you have been working.
In this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next option is
the cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the pulldown
first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select
from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to
the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. <P>

If you know your VO URL already, you can jump down to the Cone Search
URL box and type or paste your URL into the box and hit search.<P>

More commonly, however, users do not know <em>a priori</em> which URL
to use. Click on "Find Astronomical Data Resources" to be droped into
a VO search. Find the URL corresponding to the catalog you want, copy
it, and go back and paste it in the URL box. The URL should not have
the RA and Dec in it; the tool will add your RA and Dec as listed to
the URL in the right syntax. Click on
"Search" to initiate the search. <P>

The search results are then shown (and interacted with) in the same
way as the other catalogs described here.<P>

<strong>Example</strong><p>

Load the tool. Search on IC1396. Go to the catalogs tab. Choose "VO
Catalog." It wants the root URL for a cone search. Click on "Find
Astronomical Data Resources", which goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/" target="_blank">here <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Search on IPHAS. Get <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=iphas"
target="_blank">this page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.
Look for the complete catalog release (not just one associated with
one specific study). The name of the catalog goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/directory/getRecord.aspx?id=ivo://CDS.VizieR/II/321"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Hit
the [+] to expand it. There is one URL listed there, under "available
endpoints for the standard interface." Copy that URL and paste it into
the search form. The IRSA tool will append your coordinates and radius
and return you a table.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting.</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>
Note that searching the VO means that you are using resources not
specifically housed at IRSA, so servers may be down, or timeouts set,
or limits on numbers of returned sources, etc., that are beyond our
control. In most cases the solution is to specify as precise a search
as possible.  The URL you enter into the box in Finder Chart must be a
Cone Search base URL (not containing RA and Dec parameters, which are
inserted into the URL by the tool in response to the search
parameters you give it).

<LI>The master list of registries is <a href="http://rofr.ivoa.net/"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. You
can also search the registries directly via that link (as opposed to
via the IRSA tools). 

</UL><P>


<h3><A name="nedcatalogs">NED Catalogs</A> -- Overlaying
catalogs obtained from NED</h3>

(NED= <A href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NASA
Extragalactic Database <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the right, "NED", to search for
and load a catalog from NED.<P>

<img src="img/nedcat.png" width="100%"><P>


As for the other catalog searches, the tool pre-fills the target
position with the coordinates of the target with which you have been
working. In this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next
option is the cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the
pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and
then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the
old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to
your search radius; it will tell you if you request something too big
or too small. <P>


The search results are then shown (and interacted with) in the same
way as the other catalogs described here.<P>
