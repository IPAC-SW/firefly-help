<h3><A NAME="purpose">Purpose of Tool</A></h3>

The Time Series Tool allows exploration and analysis of time series
observations. <P>

For WISE/NEOWISE and PTF/ZTF, you can view measurements as a
function of time, simultaneously visualize the single-epoch images,
and optionally find the period of variability. For other data sets,
visualization of the single-epoch images is not currently available,
but period analysis is available. <P>



<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>


The words in blue rectangles are "<strong>tabs</strong>."<br>
<img src="img/bluetabsTSV.png"><P>

This is the "<strong>image toolbox</strong>":<br>
<img src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br>
In the IRSA Viewer, this image toolbox is always present as a row of
tools just under the IRSA banner. This toolbox operates on any images
that are loaded into the tool. <P>


Your browser window is divided into "<strong>panes</strong>", like
"window panes." The contents of the panes depends on what you are
doing with the tool, but could include a pane that includes a set of
images, a pane that has the catalog used for the time series, and/or a
plot pane.   You can expand any of the window panes by clicking on the
expand icon: <img src="img/expand-24x24.png"> <p>

After loading a light curve, you are in the "Viewer." From the Viewer,
you can launch the "Period Finder" to set a period. After you set a
period, you return to the "Viewer." <P>


<h3><A NAME="data">Data Sets Accepted</A></h3>


For WISE/NEOWISE and PTF/ZTF, you can view measurements as a function
of time, simultaneously visualize the single-epoch images, and
optionally find the period of variability. <P>

For other data sets, visualization of the single-epoch images is not
currently available, but period analysis is available. <P>
