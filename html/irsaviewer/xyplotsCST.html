<h2>Plots</h2>

Plots can be made from <a href="tables.html">Tables</A>, and plots are
made automatically in the Catalog Search Tool when catalogs are
loaded. Plotting is covered in this section. The <a
href="tablesCST.html">Tables</A> section discusses tables more generally.
The <a href="visualizationCST.html">Visualization</A> section covers how
a catalog is overlaid on images. <P>

<h3><a name="default">Default Plot</A></h3>

By default, after a catalog has loaded, a plot appears in the upper
right of your browser window.<P>

To obtain a full-screen view of your plot, click on the expand icon in
the upper right of the window pane when your mouse is in the window:
<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. To return to the prior view, click
the "Close" arrow in the upper left.<P>

The plotting tool, by default, starts with RA and Dec plotted if it
can find RA and Dec in the catalog. Note that it does so following
astronomical convention -- RA increases to the left. If the catalog
does not have RA and Dec, it plots the first two numerical columns it
finds. <P>

<h3><a name="firstlook">Plot format: a first look</A></h3>

If you have loaded a catalog with many (&gt; 15,000) points, you may
have an RA/Dec plot that looks something like the one on the left
here. If you have loded a catalog with few (&lt; 15,000) points, you
will have an RA/Dec plot that looks more like the one on the right
here.<br> <img src="img/defaultradecbinned.png" width="50%"><img
src="img/defaultradecunbinned.png" width="50%"><P>

The difference between them is that, for larger catalogs (left), the
plot is binned -- more points are encompassed in a black tile and
fewer points are encompassed in a white tile. In the context of this
tool, this is called a <strong>heatmap</strong>. For smaller catalogs
(right), each individual point is shown as a blue dot. In the context
of this tool, this is called a <strong>scatter plot</strong>. <P>

In either case, letting your mouse hover over a point tells you the
values of the point under your cursor, and (if binned) how many points
are represented:<br> <img src="img/morethanonepoint.png"> for binned
plots, and <br> <img src="img/justonepoint.png"> for just one point.
<br> <img src="img/morethanonepoint2.png"> Clicking (in an unbinned
plot)  highlights that point, and it stays highlighted, though you
must keep your mouse on the point in order to see the information
about how many points it represents.<P>

You can change the bin size and shading. If you have a binned plot,
you have a "binning options" arrow near the bottom of the plot options
pop-up. You can choose whether the binning is set automatically (leave
boxes blank), or by you (populate the boxes). You can also choose if
the grey shading is set linearly or logarithmically.  NOTE
THAT you can't change the bin size in just one direction; if you enter
a number for the "Number of x-bins" box, you must also enter a number
for the "Number of y-bins" box.<P>

The reason the tool makes a heatmap for large catalogs this is to more
fairly represent the point density -- and to make the plotting faster.
In these cases, though, it will not give you the option to overplot
errors (see below). If you have a heatmap and want a scatter plot, you
need to filter or otherwise restrict the catalog to have fewer points
(see below).<P>


<h3><a name="linking">Plot Linking:</A> Plots are linked to catalog and image(s)</h3>

If you move your mouse over any of the points in the plot, you will
get a pop-up telling you the values corresponding to the point under
your cursor. For scatter plots, if you click on any of the points, the
object(s) corresponding to that point will be highlighted in the
overlays in the images shown, and highlighted in the catalog table. 
This works the other way too - click on a row in the catalog, or an
object in the images, and the object will be highlighted in the plot
or the catalog or the image.<P>

<h3><a name="changing">Changing what is plotted</A></h3>

To change what is plotted, click on the gears icon in the upper right
of the plot window pane: <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"
align="center">. Configuration options then appear; the options are a
little different depending on whether the points are binned or
not:<br>  <img src="img/plotoptionspopup-decimated.png" width="30%">
&nbsp; &nbsp; <img src="img/plotoptionspopup.png" width="30%"><br> The
left has the options for binned plots, and the right has the options
for plots that have individual points shown.<P>

<DL><dt><strong>Both kinds of plots have the following
options.</strong>
<dd>
In either case, you can specify what should be plotted on each
axis. The magnifying glass is a link that brings up a table that lists
all of the available columns in the catalog. Alternatively, you can
just start typing, and viable options appear below the box. Whatever
you put in the box must match the column name as shown in the catalog
<em>exactly</em>. <P>

Click on the triangle to open additional options for the layout. <P>

In both of the examples above, RA is plotted on the x-axis. It has
pulled the column name for the label; in this table, the column is
"ra" rather than "RA". It has copied over the units ("deg") from the
catalog. You can change what column is plotted, as well as what label
and units are shown in the plot. <P>

You can enter <strong>simple mathematical relations</strong> in these
boxes too, such as "w1mpro-w4mpro" to put [W1]-[W4] on one axis.
Supported operators:
<UL>
<LI>+,-,*,/
<LI>abs(x), acos(x), asin(x), atan(x), atan2(x), ceil(x), cos(x),
exp(x), floor(x), lg(x), ln(x), log10(x), log(x), power(x,y),
round(x), sin(x), sqrt(x), tan(x)
<LI>Non-alphanumeric column names (e.g., those with - or + or similar
characters) should be quoted in expressions.
</UL>
<P>

In both kinds of plots (scatter or heatmap [binned]), you can enter
the label for the axes, and choose whether or not a grid is included
on that axis, and whether or not the axis is reversed -- in this case,
because it's plotting RA, the x-axis is reversed. <P>

By default, the boundaries of the plot are set to encompass the full
data range. Here you can change the boundaries to specific numbers.
(This can also be set via filtering from the plot; see below.)<P>

If you want a square or rectangular plot, you can change the x/y ratio
as displayed.<P>

Click "Apply" to apply, and "Close" to return to the plot without
making changes.<P>

<dt><strong>Options found only in binned plots</strong>
<dd>(Plots are binned if there are &gt; 15,000 points in the catalog.)
From the pop-up, you can control the color table that is used
(greyscale is the default; there are many other choices in the
pulldown menu), as well as the number of bins in the x and y
directions.   If you change the number of bins but then want to go
back to the original values, leave the "Number of bins" boxes
blank.<P>


<dt><strong>Options found only in plots showing individual points</strong>
<dd>In these plots, at the top of the plot options pop-up,  you can
control whether the points are shown as individual points, connected
points, or just a line. <P>

You can specify an error (either a column in the catalog, or
calculated from a column in the catalog). Those errors can be
symmetric or asymmetric (see pulldown menu). <P>

You can also change either axis to be logarithmically scaled.
<P>
</dl>


Example: Load a WISE catalog. Plot w1snr vs. w1mpro. Change the labels
by clicking on the triangles below each entry box, and make the label
"SNR in WISE-1" rather than the more cryptic column header "w1snr".
Depending on your catalog, you may need to adjust the y axis range.
Obtain this plot:<P>

src="img/w1snrexampleconfig.png" width="30%"><p>


<h3><a name="manipulating">Plotting Manipulated Columns</A></h3>

You can choose a single column to plot against another column, as
above. However, you can also do simple mathematical manipulations.<P>

For example, if you have loaded a WISE catalog, you can plot [W1]-[W2]
vs. [W3]-[W4]. In terms of the names of the columns in the database,
this is w1mpro-w2mpro vs. w3mpro-w4mpro.  <br>

<img src="img/wisecolorexample.png" width="70%"><img
src="img/wisecolorexampleconfig.png" width="30%"><p>

If you have few enough points that the plot is not binned, you can add
errors, and you can also manipulate those:<br> <img
src="img/plotoptionspopup2.png"><br>  In this case, the positions
in this catalog are in degrees, but the errors are in arcseconds.
This plot request converts the errors to degrees
before plotting. <P>

<h3><a name="restricting">Restricting What is Plotted</A></h3>

You can also restrict what data are plotted in any of several
different ways. <P>

You can set axis limits on the plot itself from the plot options
pop-up (discussed above).<P>

However, and perhaps more powerfully, you can set limits from the plot
itself using a rubber band zoom.  Click and drag in a sub-region of
the plot. A new icon appears in the upper right of the plot: <img
src="img/plotoptions.png">. This means "filter the catalog to leave
only those points encompassed by the selection in the plot." If you
click on the zoom icon, then the plot axes change to encompass just
the sources you have selected. If you click on the filter icon, then
the catalog view is filtered down, restricted to just those sources
you have selected, and the plot is zoomed in; the filter notes just
above the plot (and the above the table, as applicable) change to
remind you that you have a filter applied. Only those data points that
pass the filter are shown in the plot, in the table, and/or overlaid
on the image(s). (This is the behavior of 'filter', as opposed to
'select'; the former restricts what is shown, the latter just
highlights the points.) For more on filters, see <a
href="tables.html#filters">the filtering dicussion in the tables
section</A>.<P>

<!-- If you have a big catalog, zooming or filtering may reduce the number
of plotted points to below 15,000, which means
that then individual points can be shown, rather than binned
points.<P> -->

If you move your mouse over any of the points, you will get a pop-up
telling you the values corresponding to the point under your cursor.
If you click on any of the points, the object(s) corresponding to that
point will be highlighted in the overlays in the images shown, and
highlighted in the catalog table.  This works the other way too -
click on a row in the catalog, or an object in the images, and the
object will be highlighted in the plot or the catalog or the image.<P>

You can also zoom with your mouse on the plot -- do whatever you would
do with your mouse to scroll but with your mouse over the plot. You
can also grab-and-drag the plot axes to change the plotting range.<P>

<h3><a name="saving">Saving Plots</A> </h3>

Click on the diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">). Your plot will
then be saved as a png file. 
The saved PNG is the same size as it is on your screen. If you want a
big version, make the desired plot big on your screen (expand the view
to take up as much space as possible) before saving the PNG. <P>
 <P>



<h3><a name="examples">Examples of catalog plots</A></h3>

<strong>Example: Plotting [W1] vs. [W1]-[W4] in a star-forming
region</strong><P>

In a star-forming region defined for this example, we are trying to
find young stars. We will search in the WISE AllWISE catalog. Stars
without circumstellar dust should be at a variety of W1 brightnesses,
but all have [W1]-[W4]~0.  Background galaxies should be faint and
red. Stars with circumstellar dust (e.g., young stars) should be
bright and red. Here, we will make a plot, identify a bright and red
object in the plot, and find where it is in the WISE images.

<OL>
<LI>Launch the Catalog Search Tool. Select WISE AllWISE.
Enter target as IC1396.  Select a radius size of 0.5 degree.  Click
'Run Query.'
<LI>The catalog is plotted in the upper right, overplotted on the
image in the upper left, and listed as a table at the bottom. Note
that all ~17,500 sources are overplotted on the image  and in the
plot, but only the first 100 are shown in the catalog (though all are
loaded).  Note that selecting a source in the image makes its
corresponding row in the catalog change color and point in the plot
change color; this is all interchangable such that picking a source in
one place highlights it in the other places. (In the image, your
selected source has an x in the symbol. You may have to enlarge the
image to see your selected source in the image.)
<LI>The plot comes up with an RA/Dec plot by default. Because there
are more than 15,000 points in this catalog, it is a binned (heatmap)
plot; each point represents more than one row of the catalog. Mouse
over a point to see how many rows are represented: <img
src="img/morethanonepoint.png">
<LI>Click on the expand (<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">) icon in the
upper right of the plot window to make it big. 
<LI>Click on the gear <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"> icon in the
upper left of the plot window to change what is plotted.
<LI>Enter in the x box: w1mpro-w4mpro. This is WISE-1 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes minus WISE-4 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes,or [W1]-[W4]. 
<LI>Enter in the y box: w1mpro. This is the [W1] mag.
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "Layout options", and enter
"[W1]-[W4] (mag)" for the x-label, and "[W1] (mag)" for the y-label.
Click on "reverse" to make the brighter objects appear at the top of
the plot. Check "grid" to make the grid appear for both axes.
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "Y label/unit", and enter [W1] for
the label. Enter "mag" for the unit.  Click the "grid" box.
<LI>Click "Apply."
<LI>Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex1-plot.png" width="75%"><br>
<LI>Note that the points are shades of grey, denoting that
at least one of the points in the plot is representative of more than
one row in the catalog. The legend for how many points correspond to
each shade of grey is given on the right.
<LI>Click and drag from corner given approximately by (2,6) to (7,11). 
<LI>The icons in the upper right change after you do this, and we want
to filter on this region. Click on the filter icon. This filters the
table as well as the plot. Close the plot ("Close" in the upper left)
and go back to the table.
<LI>After this filtering, you should have about 250 points left in the
catalog. Since this is few enough points (&lt; 15,000), we now have
just a scatter plot (as opposed to the heatmap with shades of grey).<br>
<img src="img/ex1-plotp2.png"><br>
The points are shown as blue circles. Where they overlap, the blue appears darker.  
<LI>Find the brightest source near [W1]-[W4]~4.5. Click on that point. 
<LI>The (astrophysically) bright and red object we selected in the
plot is highlighted in the overlays on top of the image and in the
catalog (though you may need to scroll in the catalog to find the
green highlighted line). To find it even more easily, you can click
and drag around this point in the plot. Click on the filter icon in
the upper left. The plot at this point looks silly, but only that
point is left in the overlay of sources on the image and in the
catalog list. (If you have been following closely, it should be
J213808.44+572647.6.)  
</OL>


<strong>Abbreviated Example: Plotting [W1] vs. time with errors</strong><P>

From the Catalog Search Tool, select the "AllWISE Multiepoch
Photometry Table."  Search on RR Lyr, and ask it for a radius of only
3 arcsec. It comes back with 49 epochs. The default plot looks a
little odd because all the individual epochs are at the same position
(RA and Dec). <P>

Click on the gears to change what is plotted. For the x-axis: Ask it
to plot mjd. For the y-axis, ask it to plot w1mpro_ep, and use
w1sigmpro_ep for
the errors. Reverse the y-axis to get bright objects at the top. There
are two epochs of data obtained for this source, one near MJD~55,300
and one near 55,500. Click and drag in the plot to select one of the
two epochs and filter via the icon at the top of the plot. 

Obtain a plot something like this, which shows the error
bars for each point.  <BR> <img src="img/ex2-imgcst.png" width="50%"><P>

You can send the light curve so obtained to the Time Series Tool for
further analysis.<P>
