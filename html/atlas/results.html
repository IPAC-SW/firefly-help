<h2>Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas): Results</h2>

The Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas) returns results in an
interactive image (top) and table (bottom). The interactive table
features are described generally in <a href="tables.html">Tables
section</A>.<P>

<h3><a name="MapClick">Map Click</a></h3>

The results from a click on the map are the same as the results for a
single object (see next subsection).<P>

<h3><a name="SingleObject">Single Object</a></h3>

<p>On the <b>results page</b>, data which matched the search criteria
will be listed in tabular form as well as being rendered on a
background image.  (Note that multiple overlays for the same
position may look like one overlay.)  Any source/spectral tables found
are listed first, followed by images.  You can download or display any
of the images listed, download or display the background image,
retrieve spectra when they are available, or display source
tables.</p>

<p>The results page also contains another search form, which can be
used to fine-tune the original search or start a completely new
search. <b>Zoom</b> in and out by specifying a smaller or larger
search "Size"/"Radius", and then re-submitting the request.</p>

<p>For most of the Atlas data collections, the results are displayed
on a background which is the same size as the requested search size.
This allows the user to view the entire requested search area, with
the data results overlayed. However, for some Atlas collections,
visualization of the search results is made clearer by having a larger
background size compared to the requested search size. For these data
collections, Atlas has a set "<b>background scaling factor</b>" to
display the results; the background size is equal to the search size
times the background factor.  The Atlas search results page lists the
background factor in the lower right of the overlay image, near the
'Background Image' download option.</p>



<h3><a name="MultiObject">Multi-Object</a></h3>

After a Multi-Object search, using Table Upload, the search results
are returned in a summary table, collecting the results of each single
object search.  The table shows the positions of each requested source
(<b>ra</b> and <b>dec</b> in decimal degrees); the number of images
(<b>N_images</b>), catalog sources (<b>N_srcs</b>) and spectra
(<b>N_spectra</b>); a link to the HTML search results page
(<b>Result_Link</b>) for each source; and links to data download
scripts (<b>Download_Script</b>) for each results set (includes
images, catalogs, spectra).  The <b>Status</b> column will indicate
"ERROR" if a problem was found while searching for data for that
source, else "OK" is returned.  Note, an empty set of results (no
images, catalogs, or spectra found) is a valid result, and therefore
"OK" is returned when the search did not find an error. </p>

<p>
A <b>Download script</b> with <b>ALL the results</b> for all sources
is also available; this is a concatenation of the download scripts per
source, as one master script. Download scripts use the Unix GNU tool
'wget' for bulk downloads.  (<a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/batch_download_help.html"
target="_blank">wget Help <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></a>)  </p>
<p>
Clicking a <b>Result_Link</b> brings up a single object search results
page;  this page is identical to the result if a "Single Object" was
used in the search form for that same position.
</p>

<p>
For reference, the user's table is available.  Note, IRSA adds
<b>ra</b> and <b>dec</b> coordinates for each  source in decimal
degrees, if these columns are not provided.  The table is also 
reformatted to <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank"><i>IPAC Table Format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></i></a>,  if it is not already uploaded as such.  The
order of the user table sources and the results table summary are the
same;  the "<b>cnt</b>" (counter) column is the row number of the
input user table.

  </p>

<h3><a name="noresults">No Results</a></h3>

<p> If no data are found for the selected area, a
"<b>NOTIFICATION</b>" page is returned stating that the collection
does not have data within the input search parameters. If you think
there should be data, hit the 'Back' button on your browser to return
to the search page and try again with different search criteria, e.g.
broaden the search by increasing the Size of the search box and/or
radius, or by de-selecting the "Images must cover coordinate"
checkbox. </p>


<h3><a name="background" id="background"></a><a name="bgdata"><a name="table1">Background Data Sets</a></a></h3>

Most of the background data come from either the IRSA <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/ISSA/" target="_blank">ISSA
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> or <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/2mass.html"
target="_blank">2MASS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>
image collections.</p>


<h3><a name="results">Result Categories</a></h3>

  <p><b>Small Catalog and/or Spectral results</b> are listed first in
  the "Table of Sources", if present.  If the total is under 6000, the
  source positions are marked on the background image. There are links
  to spectra files in the individual tables.</p>

  <p><b>Image results</b> are overlayed on the background sky image
  and are also individually presented in up to three tables: a master
  "Image Header Table" below the background image, a "Group" table
  with keys to the color overlays when images are grouped into
  separate categories, and a new feature: an interactive, sortable
  table of "All Images".  It is from this last table that you can
  download and/or display the images.  "Cutouts" of the original image
  are sometimes available, when the original images may be too
  large.  If the "Entire Image" is too large to display, you will
  see an error message.  In this case, display the "Cutout" instead.</p>

  <p>The "All Images" table contains the distance of the image center
  from the requested position.  By default, the rows are sorted by
  distance <i>within each instrument group</i>.  You can change the
  default sorting and select/sort the rows you want by <a
  href="tables.html#filters">filtering</A>.</p>


<h3><a name="bulk">Bulk Download</a></h3>

  <p>
  <b>Bulk Download</b> of data is also available from the results
  pages, using a wget script.  For more information on wget, 
  click <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/batch_download_help.html" target="_blank">here
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" target="help" height="10"></a></a>.  The script contains
  a list of all the images, catalogs, and/or spectra returned in the
  search results.
