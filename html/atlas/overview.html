<h2>Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas): Overview</h2>

The Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas) allows users to survey IRSA's
holdings within a given project (or delivery) to see what data
(images, catalogs, spectra) overlap a position on the sky. <P>

Some data sets have additional customization in the form of summary
tables, preview pages for individual objects, non-spatial ancillary
products (PSFs, models), etc.  <P>

The results from this search also include an option to pass the data
to <a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer/"
target="_blank">IRSA Viewer <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a different tool at IRSA.<P>
