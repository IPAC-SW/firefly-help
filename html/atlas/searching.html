<h2>Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas): Searching</h2>

The Image and Spectrum Viewer (Atlas) allows users to survey IRSA's
holdings within a given project (or delivery) to see what data
(images, catalogs, spectra) overlap a position on the sky.<P>

<p>Each dataset has a homepage with a short description. Generally an
all-sky image (or a smaller region) is presented at the top of the
homepage in black and white. Often this image is made from 12 micron
IRAS Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA) "plates", with a resolution of 0.5
degrees.  The color overlays on this image are the footprints of the
areas covered by that dataset.  <i>Image</i> data are usually
displayed as <i>red rectangles</i> overlaid on the sky, <i>yellow
dots</i> indicate <i>source lists</i>, and <i>red (or cyan) dots</i>
represent <i>spectra</i>. The <i>coordinate system</i>, if displayed,
is usually depicted in <i>blue</i>.</p>

Below the image, you can find the search form itself.<P>

<h3><a name="targetselection">Target Selection</a></h3>


<p>There are three methods for retrieving data through Atlas. You may
either click on the image (all-) sky map within an area shown to
contain data, or enter a single coordinate (or astronomical object
name) in the "<b>Single Object</b>" field, or enter a file name with a
table of coordinates (or astronomical object names) in the "<b>Table
Upload</b>" field.<P>

<h3><a name="MapClick">Map Click</a></h3>

Click in the image to search around the region under your mouse cursor.<P>

If using the image map for searching, keep in mind that the pixel
resolution of an all-sky image is often 0.5 degrees; if you require a
higher degree of precision you should use the coordinate search
method.  

<h3><a name="SingleObject">Single Object: Coordinate or Object Name</a></h3>
  
If entering a position, the location information can take the form of
coordinates in a variety of formats (see the examples at the bottom of
main panel), or can be an object name. If it is the latter, first <a
href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NED <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></a> and then <a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/" target="_blank">SIMBAD
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> are checked to attempt
name resolution; once the name is resolved, the celestial coordinates
of that object are used for the search query.</p>

<p><b>Examples of valid input coordinates</b> are provided for each of
the Atlas data services, in a variety of coordinate systems. Each
example coordinate is separated by a "|" character. Only one is
necessary as input in the "Single Object" field (or in the
multi-object table listing using "Table Upload"), without the "|"
character. The default coordinate system is (RA DEC) Equatorial J2000,
in decimal degrees (1st example below).</p>

  <p><a name="examples" id="examples"></a></p>
Examples of input coordinates:
<OL>
<LI>Equatorial J2000 (eq): "290.971773 11.774474
<LI>eq"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Local Equatorial J2000 (Equ): "19h23m53.23s +11d46m28.1s
<LI>Equ J2000"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Galactic (ga): "47.09669 -1.71325
<LI>ga"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<LI>Object Name: "M 16"
</OL>

<p>In the 2nd example above, "Local Equatorial J2000 (Equ)" is
also known as "sexigesimal" (hours, minutes, seconds; degrees,
minutes, seconds). The abbreviation "eq" and "Equ" stands for
equinox of the coordinate system; typically equinox is "J2000"
(which is the default when the user does not enter the equinox)
and of course could also be "B1950", <i>etc</i>.</p>


<h3><a name="MultiObject">Multi-Object</a></h3>

  <p>
  <b>Multi-Object</b> searching can be performed by selecting the
  "<b>Table Upload</b>" button and then entering the name of a table 
  on your local file system which contains a list of coordinates or 
  astronomical object names.

</p><p>IRSA accepts four ASCII table formats for table upload:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="IPAC_ASCII_one_header.tbl">IPAC ASCII Column-Aligned</a></li>
  <li><a href="csv_table_example.tbl">Comma-Separated Values (CSV) or Comma-Delimited</a></li>
  <li><a href="tab_delimited_table_example.tbl">Tab-Delimited</a></li>
  <li><a href="list_of_obj_names.tbl">A Simple List of Objects (such as astronomical source names)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There are two ways to ensure your tables will work with IRSA's services:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run your tables through IRSA's <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">Table Validator <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> tool to identify possible
errors.</li>
  <li>Read and follow the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/table_upload_help.html"
target="_blank">Using Tables With IRSA Services  <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> help document to learn and
troubleshoot table formats, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Detailed descriptions of the four acceptable table formats</li>
    <li>A description of how sexagesimal and Galactic coordinates are handled by IRSA services</li>
    <li>Best practices for creating tables</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting solutions for common error messages  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


  You can click on the "Browse" button to help you select your table
  of sources from your file system. Here are some examples of the same
  10 sources in various formats:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="ascii_names.txt">ASCII file</a> with simple name listing  </li>
  <li><a href="ipac_names.tbl">IPAC table format using object names</a></li>
  <li><a href="ipac_coords.tbl">IPAC table format with ra dec</a> positions as well as source names </li>
  <li><a href="ipac_mixcoords.tbl">IPAC table format with mixture of coord types</a> </li>
  <li><a href="tab_coords.tbl">tab-delimited table of positions</a> as well as source names</li>
  <li><a href="comma_coords.tbl">comma-delimited table of positions</a> as well as source names</li> 
  </ul>

  Please note, <b>space-delimited</b> files are only valid if using
 IPAC table format. <p></p>




<h3><a name="searchsize">Search Size Constraints</a></h3>


<p>For Atlas datasets which include images, the "<b>Size</b>" search
field (in degrees) is adjustable.  The maximum search size is listed,
and the hard limit is 12.5 degrees. <a href="results.html#table1">The
table</a> (in the results section) lists all the maximum search sizes
for all Atlas collections, in the third column. (The hard limit is due
to the fact that the results are displayed as overlays on background
'sky' images.  A value of 12.5 degrees is a reasonable limit for the
ISSA "plates", the largest background images.)</p>

<p><a name="covers" id="covers"></a> The checkbox "<b>Images must
cover coordinate</b>" allows the user to choose to search for only
those images whose footprint on the sky covers the exact input
coordinate. If unchecked, all images which overlap the given search
area, as determined by location and box size, will be returned.</p>

<p>For Atlas datasets which have catalog or spectral information, the
"<b>Source Search Radius</b>" field is provided and can be adjusted
for searching. This is a cone search, using a <b>radius</b> where the
units can be adjusted using a drop-down menu. The default is half the
<b>Size</b> and the maximum is 6.25 degrees.</p>

<p><a name="region" id="region"></a> Next to the "Source Seach Radius"
field is the checkbox "<b>Match with image search size</b>". When
checked, the search for catalog and spectral information is done using
half the value of the "Size" box search (or 6.25 degrees when "Size"
is not set); note that the "Source Search Radius" value is overridden
in this case.</p>

<p>If searching by location rather than clicking on the sky map,
hitting the "<b>Submit</b>" button starts the search.</p>

<h3><a name="references">References</a></h3>

Every project should have some sort of documentation that arrived with
the data. Usually they have published papers as well. References to
those papers can be found at the bottom of the search page.<P>
