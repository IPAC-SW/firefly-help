<h2>Understanding Your Search Results from the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h2>


This section is an overview of what exactly is returned by a Spitzer
Heritage Archive (SHA) search. After a general description of some
common options, including how to download data, the individual tabs
are discussed, and then we discuss how to further refine the search
results by imposing filters.<P>

<A NAME="commonoptions"><H3>Common Options</H3></A>

<dl>
<dt><em>Downloading Data</em>
<dd>In order to download data, click on the checkbox to
the left of the entry you want to download, and then click on the
"Prepare Download" button at the top of the column. (Select all of
them at once by clicking the checkbox at the top of that column.) The
<a href="downloads.html">Background Monitor</A> is then launched to
prepare your data for download. When your packaged data are ready,
save your data to disk. (The <a
href="#contribenhprod">Contributed Enhanced Products</A> are a
little different; see below.)<P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. For some overly
helpful browsers and small downloads, it may appear to have not done
anything; it just did it transparently quickly.<P>

<em>Red lines</em> -- some searches may return lines that are shaded
red. These data cannot be downloaded because they are still
proprietary. If they are your data, <a href="user.html">log in</A> and
you should be able to download them.  If they are not your data, you
can download those data after they become public, usually about 12
months after they were taken.  You can add the release date as one of
the <a href="#newcolumns">additional columns to display</A> in the
search results pane.<P>

<dt><a name="restrictingdata"><em>Restricting data in other
tabs</em></A> <dd>By default, the search results come up with a list
of <b>all</b> returned AORs in the AOR tab and a list of <b>a lot</b>
of corresponding files in the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs -- and it can
be a <b>long</b> list -- for ALL of those AORs.  These specific files
vary according to the observation; they include the pipeline products
such as a mosaic or extracted spectrum that is probably the primary
goal of your search.  If you want to limit exactly which files are
listed in the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs, be sure that the "Restrict
data in other tabs" box is checked (it should be by default) and then
check the box in the row you want to examine.  This is most
conceptually straightforward if you select an AOR entry and then
examine all of the Level 1 and/or 2 files that correspond specifically
to that AOR, as opposed to selecting one of the subsidiary files and
then going to another tab, though it works that way too.<P>

<b>Note that</b> the enhanced products tabs are different. The SHA
can't take you back to the AORs from the contributed products (since
some were created from intermediate processing versions); the
SSC-generated enhanced products include within them pointers to the
original AORs that were used to create them, but this is not currently
retrievable via a single click within the SHA.<P>

<dt><em>Saving the results</em>
<dd>The search results can be saved to a text file by clicking the
"Save" button or viewed as a text file by clicking the "Text View"
button. Various information is included in the header of the file to
give some indication of the origin of the search.<P>

<dt><em>Filtering</em>
<dd>Filters can be added interactively -- see <a
href="#filter">Filtering</A> below for more information.<P>

<dt><a name="newcolumns"><em>Adding/removing columns or rows</em></A>
<dd>Several columns come up in each of these tabs by default, and the
default number of rows returned is 50 per page. These values can be
changed by clicking on the table options on the far upper right of the
corresponding tab's columns (<img src="img/tableoptions.png">).
If you can't see this icon, it may be that the results pane is too
small; grab the divider between panes and slide it to the right until
you can see this icon. <P>

Note that the entire set of results can be sorted alphabetically by
clicking on any column's name.<P>

Note also that if you resize columns, and then go and add new columns,
the original columns are resized back to their defaults after the new
columns are added.<P>

You can scroll through pages by the arrows on the top center of the
search results and see how many rows there are total via the count
indicated there.  Do you have "too many rows" to easily sift through? 
Further restrict the search by imposing additional <a
href="#filter">filtering</A>; see below!<P>

Note that expanding the page size to numbers much greater than 50 may
result in a substantial performance degradation (e.g., your browser
will appear to freeze or not appear to be doing anything while it
manages and renders the large table). <P>


<dt><em>Getting more information on any row</em> 
<dd>Letting your mouse hover over many items will reveal some
information in a "tool tip".  Selecting any of the table entries
results in different items appearing in the <a
href="details.html">Details Pane</A>.  Please see that section for more
information.<P>


<dt><em>Changing the size of the window or columns</em> 
<dd>You can click and drag the divider between the columns or window
pane. There is also a pair of black arrows (<img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">) that appears in the upper right corner of
any window pane when your mouse hesitates; clicking on that expands
the window to take up the whole browser window. To return to the prior
view, click "Close" in the upper left corner of the
expanded view. <P>

</dl>

<A NAME="aor"><!-- --></A><H3>Observation (AOR) Tab</H3>

(An individual Spitzer observation is an <em>AOR, or Astronomical
Observation Request</em>; see <a
href="overview.html#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was found via your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
is returned here in this tab. Because each AOR can result in
<em>many</em> other files, this AOR tab is the best place to start
browsing!  (The other tabs -- Level 1 and Level 2 -- will have more
additional files listed per AOR, and once you download the data,
you'll have even more files that come with the download. The enhanced
products will have a different sort of diversity of files, depending
on which products are available.)<P>

<em>Column Headings</em>:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The target name was supplied by the original observer and may be
enlightening or cryptic. <P>

<LI>The RA and Dec are the target of the AOR as observed.  <P>

<LI>If the object was observed as a moving target, the NAIF ID is
listed; otherwise, this is blank.<P>

<LI>The instrument and observing mode are listed next.<P>

<LI>The AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
observation in the SHA. <P>

<LI>The AOR label was supplied by the original observer and may be clear
or it may be cryptic. <P>

<LI>The Observation start time is the time, in UT, that the observation
was begun.<P>

<LI>The Program ID is the integer identifier for the program under which
these observations were obtained.<P>

<LI>The Principal Investigator (PI) for these data is listed last in the
default display.<P>

<LI>An additional column can be added which indicates whether the
observation was an AOR or an IER; other columns can be added as well.
(click on <img src="img/tableoptions.png"> at the top right of the tab window
to do this.)<P>

</UL>

<em>Do you have "too much data" in the subsidiary search result
tabs?</em>  See
<a href="#restrictingdata">restricting data in other tabs</A> --
for example, limit the Level 1 and Level 2 tabs to be just the files
from one AOR.  Do you have "too many rows"?  Further restrict the
search by imposing additional <a href="#filter">filtering</A> -- for
example, limiting it to be just IRAC channel 1 data.  <em>In summary,
restricting data in other tabs means selecting the checkbox for a row
of the table and seeing the files corresponding to that row in the
other tabs, whereas filtering corresponds to limiting the rows to
specific values in the columns.</em>  <P>

<A NAME="bcd"><!-- --></A><H3>Level 1 (BCD) Tab</H3>

(The individual data frames that emerge [calibrated] from the
Spitzer pipeline are <em>Level 1, or Basic Calibrated Data, or
BCDs</em>; see <a
href="overview.html#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was returned by your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
can result in <em>many</em> other files.  This Level 1 (BCD) tab
contains all of the BCDs  that correspond to the AORs returned (or
selected) in the AOR tab. (Additional Level 1 products will arrive
with your download, such as errors and masks.)<P>

<strong>Note: For IRAC subarray data, only Level 1 (BCD) data are
returned. There is no Level 2 product.</strong><P>

<em>Column Headings</em>:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
observation in the SHA. (Note that each AOR results in many files, and
that you can restrict the contents of this tab to be just those files
corresponding to one AOR; see <a href="#restrictingdata">"Restricting
data in other tabs" above</A>.)<P>

<LI>The BCD ID is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
particular file in the SHA. <P>

<LI>The instrument and observing mode are listed next.<P>

<LI>The specific bandpass of this individual file is in the next
column.<P>

<LI>The RA and Dec are listed in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.  If "no
data" or other unusual values appear here, this is most likely a
calibration file.<P>

<LI>The exposure time corresponding to this file is given in
seconds.<P>

<LI>Particularly in the case of MIPS, the arrays may be on and
collecting data even if the telescope is being used to observe using
one of the other fields of view in the instrument.  For any given row,
if the telescope was optimized for use of the field of view to which
the specific file applies, then the "primary field" column is 1; other
values indicate that this is serendipitous data.  See the MIPS
Instrument Handbook (available on the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/" target="_blank">IRSA
Spitzer website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>) for more information on how to use these data.<P>

<LI>Since there can be files at the BCD level that are not images
(such as tables of data), the "File Type" column lists the nature of
the file. "Image" will be the most common.<P>

<LI>The file name of the corresponding file once it is unpacked and
resident on your disk is listed.  The filename contains information
about the instrument, channel, and originating AOR as well as the
specific contents of the file; see the <a

Spitzer website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, specifically the Instrument Handbooks, for a comprehensive
listing of the files available at the BCD level (Level 1). <P>

<LI>Several additional columns can be added to the BCD view.  Most of
these should be self-explanatory from the column headers (or the tool
tips) appearing in the pop-up window that appears when you add columns
(<a href="#commonoptions">see more information on options found in
every tab</A> -- in brief, click on <img src="img/tableoptions.png"> at the top
right of the tab window). <P>

<A NAME="pbcd"><!-- --></A><H3>Level 2 (PBCD) Tab</H3>

(The products that come from combining these individual data frames
[such as mosaics of individual pointings] are <em>Level 2, or
post-BCD, or PBCD data</em>; see <a
href="#terminology">terminology</A> above.)<P>

Each AOR that was returned by your <a href="searching.html">search</A>
can result in <em>many</em> other files.  This Level 2 (post-BCD) tab
contains all of the Level 2 products that correspond to the AORs
returned (or selected) in the AOR tab. (Additional Level 2 products
will arrive with your download, such as errors and coverage maps.)<P>

<strong>Note: For IRAC subarray data, there are no Level 2
products.</strong><P>


<em>Column Headings</em>:<P>

<UL>

<LI>The AORKEY is a large integer that uniquely identifies this
observation in the SHA. (Note that each AOR results in many files, and
that you can restrict the contents of this tab to be just those files

the file. "Image" will be the most common; IRS data results in a lot
of tables.<P>

<LI>The file name of the corresponding file once it is unpacked and

about the instrument, channel, and originating AOR as well as the
specific contents of the file; see the <a

<H3><A NAME="filter">Filtering -- Imposing additional
filters to get the most out of your search results</A></H3>

Even if your search returned only one AOR, you could have 
<em>many</em> files that appear in the Level 2 (PBCD) or Level 1 (BCD)
tabs.  In order to quickly weed through what files appear in the tab
and find/examine the file you care about, <em>filtering</em> is a very
powerful tool. <P>

At the top of the tab window, there is this icon, which represents a
filter: <img src="img/filter.png">  Click on it in order to add a
filter. A text entry box appears above each of the current catalog
columns, with a small version of the filter icon corresponding to that
row on the far left. You can type operators and values in these boxes
-- hit return after typing or click in another box to implement the
filter. For fields with a limited set of choices, instead of a text
entry box, a filter icon will appear; click on it to select from the
available choices. <P>

For example, if you have searched on an IRAC AOR and would like to
only view the files relevant to the 3.6 micron channel, locate the
'Bandpass' column, click on the filter icon, and select 'IRAC 3.6 um'
from the pop-up with the list of choices.  Hit return or click in
another box to implement the filter.<P>

After you impose a filter, then the number of rows in the catalog is
restricted according to the rules you have specified, and the
"filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane has changed to
remind you that there has been a filter applied, in this case just one
filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on
the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>

You can add additional filters to further restrict your list of
files.  Note that the filters are logically "AND"ed together -- that
is, if you impose "Bandpass=IRAC 3.6 um" and "Bandpass=IRAC 4.5 um",
no data will result, because no data are both 3.6 and 4.6 microns at
the same time. If you want to see just the 3.6 and 4.5 micron data,
select more than one bandpass from the pulldown by selecting "select
multiple" and selecting the multiple options you want.  <P>

A more complex but still common application of filters would be
downloading all the most recent data from a given program (e.g., data
from one program that have just been released). To do this: Search by
campaign for the most recent campaign. Many AORs will be returned. 
Once the results appear, click on "Filters". Locate the "Program ID"
column. If you have a text box, type "=" and the program ID you want.
If you have a pop-up with finite choices, select the program ID you
want. Just the AORs from that campaign and that program will
remain.<P>

NOTE THAT the filters as imposed this way only apply to your current
tab, <em>even if "restrict data in other tabs" is selected</em>!  (See
<a href="#restrictingdata">"Restricting data in other tabs" above</A>
for more information on this option -- <em>in summary, restricting data in
other tabs means selecting the checkbox for a row of the table and
seeing the files corresponding to that row in the other tabs, whereas
filtering corresponds to the values in the columns.</em>)<P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which you are querying (such as "Bandpass") is exactly equal to this value 
you are specifying (such as "IRAC 3.6um" from the pulldown).
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the
parameter  on which you are querying (such as "Bandpass") is included
within the list you are specifying (if the column filter is free-form
text, type "value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1
or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>


<A NAME="tagging"><H3>Tag It -- Tagging a search</H3></A>

Many of the papers published on Spitzer data include a list of all the
individual AORKEYs (the integer number corresponding uniquely to each
AOR) used for data discussed in that paper.  This provides an easy way
for readers to retrieve the data from the Spitzer archive, and links
can be made from ADS directly back to the SHA.<P>

However, many papers use many AORs.  Data tagging allows you to
customize the data set you use so that the link back from ADS (or
embedded in your paper itself) refers to a single unique identifier
that corresponds to all your data. (That is, a single identifier, as
opposed to a potentially long list of AORKEYs.)<P>

You yourself (independent of any publications) may also wish to repeat
a search later on for any of a number of reasons. Tagging a search
means that you can easily recreate it later.

Once you have established a search that you like and wish to repeat in
the future, click on the blue "History/Tags" tab near the top of the
browser window, then click on the "Tags" tab.  At this point, you can
enter a name for your tag, then click on the "Tag It" button. It will
then return the tag URL you can save and distribute. It also appears
in your tagging history. If you have <a href="user.html">logged
in</A>, this tagging history is available to you any time you log into
the SHA.<P>

To recreate the search, highlight the tag row you want, and click on
the "Resubmit Search" button. To remove it, click on the "Remove"
button.<P>


<A NAME="irsenh"><H3>IRS Enhanced Products Tab</H3></A>

(<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing; see <a href="overview.html#terminology">terminology</A>

<A NAME="contribenhprod"><A NAME="contribenh"><H3>Contributed Enhanced Products Tab</H3></A></A>

(<em>Enhanced Products</em> come from combining AORs or doing post
processing; see <a href="overview.html#terminology">terminology</A>
above. The community has contributed many enhanced products to the
archive.</em>)<P>

Most of the enhanced products currently available via the SHA come
from the deliveries made back to IRSA from the Legacy Teams, though
other teams including the Exploration Science teams have also made
deliveries. (<a href="searching.html#enhanced">More on enhanced
product searching</A>.) <P>

In response to a search, the Contributed Products Results tab comes up
with a "Summary View" of the search results.  By default, the results
are grouped by type -- images, catalogs, or spectra.  You can also
choose to sort the results by originating project.  <P>

The images come up quickly, and the summary page indicates how many
images from each project are returned. Note that sometimes this could
mean one image for each band, or it could mean image, errors, and
coverage for each band, or it could mean multiple resamplings of the
same bands, etc. To investigate exactly what images are available,
click on the first link in each line, the one corresponding to the
delivering project's name.  Additional tabs are spawned for each
click, containing a summary of the contents of each image or catalog.
You can make those tabs go away when you are done with them by
clicking on the x that appears when you put your mouse on the tab.<P>

Please consult the original documentation that came with the delivery
for definitions, explanations, and caveats that might go with each
product. Note that some teams delivered, e.g., GALEX and Halpha
images, so you may obtain non-Spitzer data from the Spitzer Heritage
Archive! The delivery documentation can be found on the project's page
in IRSA, which can be obtained by clicking the second link in each
line in the summary, the one that tells you more about the
delivery.<P>

Catalogs come up more slowly (because they are harder to search!), and
depending on your search, the SHA may tell you that it has completed
searching on "8 of 10 catalogs" or a similar phrase. Here too, the
catalog contents vary across projects, and even between deliveries
within the same project.  In the case of the catalogs, the "count"
tells you how many individual catalog entries there are in that
catalog for your search parameters. Click on the first link in each
line, the one corresponding to the delivering project's name, to spawn
an additional tab with the catalog values. Note that by default, only
50 lines are shown, but as these catalogs can be very long, it may
take a second or two to read in and render. The catalog columns as
displayed are exactly as provided by the original Legacy team (with
some additional columns added by IRSA to reformat the RA/Dec into
standard options), so the columns are effectively different for each
catalog. Please consult the original documentation that came with the
delivery for column definitions, caveats, etc. Such information can be
found on the project's page in IRSA, which can be obtained by clicking
the second link in each line in the summary, the one that
tells you more about the delivery.<P>

<b>NOTE:</b>  Currently, the Contributed Products search
performs a cone search of the IRSA holdings, and if you go to IRSA
directly to do what seems to be the identical search on the same
source material, it does a box search. This will result in some
apparent inconsistencies (e.g., different numbers of images or
sources) as a result of the corners of the box search area.<P>

<A NAME="precovery"><H3>Orbit Precovery Search Results</H3></A>

The search results for a Solar System Object Orbit precovery search
are presented in a very different way than those for the other
searches discussed here. Because it is looking for a series of
observations of something that is moving on the sky, it presents the
results of that search as a series of tiled images, as opposed to a
list of observations. You can switch between these views via this pair
of "view options" in the upper right of the results page: <img
src="img/tablegrid.png"> The left icon is the tiled view, and the
right icon is the table or list view.<P>

<strong>Image Previews</strong>: In the tiled view, similar to the
moving object search in the WISE Image Service, each image in which
the position of the input object is predicted to have been covered at
the time of observation. The predicted position is indicated by a blue
square on the image. An orange "x" indicates the predicted position of
the input object in previous or subsequent images (or image sets).
Clicking on any of the positions will highlight (in blue) all the
corresponding positions in the surrounding images. <P>

<strong>Orbital Path Coverage </strong>: The Orbital Path Coverage tab
in the coverage pane displays the orbital path (blue line) of the
input object during the time limits specified. The observations
returned by the search of the orbital path are indicated by orange "x"
symbols.  <P>

<strong>Table (or List) View</strong>:  The table of results provides
a list of all individual images in which the predicted position of the
input moving object is predicted to appear, given the input orbital
path. </p>
