<h2>Basic Features and Functions in the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h2>

This section is an overview of the basic features and functions of the
Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA); for an even faster overview, see the
<a href="quickguide.html">Quick-Start Guide</A>.  For more detailed
information on any of these topics, see the more detailed online help
on the left.  Note that there are also SHA video tutorials, including
a quick start and a longer AAS-demo-style overview, available at the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. Look for the playlist that
combines all the SHA videos together. <P>

The contents of this file follow the menu options (e.g., basically the
blue tabs across the top, under the IRSA menu) and major features of
the tool in the order in which you might encounter them.<br> <img

<A NAME="searching"><H3>Spitzer Searches -- The basics of searching</H3></A>

Searching the archive is straightforward, and a wide variety of
options are available on the left hand side of the search window. The
search window can be retrieved after a search by clicking on the blue
"Spitzer Searches" tab near the top.  The position search is the most
commonly used search, and appears by default.  Target names can be
automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or Simbad, or you
can specify coordinates, and you specify the search radius.  There are
many more search options, described in detail <a
href="searching.html">on the section on searching</A>.<P>

Spitzer observations can cover large areas or, by design, multiple
targets. If you are interested in just portions of the larger
observation, you can choose to have just individual data products
returned -- e.g., just the observations that went into the portion of
the sky for which you searched -- or you can return the products for
the whole AOR.<P>

You can refine your search for observations by instrument or by
wavelength.<P>

The search results appear in up to seven tabs: AORs, Level 1 (BCD),
Level 2 (PBCD), IRS Enhanced Products, Super Mosaics, Source Lists and
Contributed Enhanced Products.  Each tab provides a different look at
the data retrieved by your search. (See the section on <a
href="results.html">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.)<P>

You may wish to impose additional filters on your search results; see
<a href="results.html#filter">the section on filtering</A> for more
information on filtering.<P>

The tabs on the far right of the SHA results page aid in visualizing
exactly what data have been retrieved. You can examine individual data
frames, or see what parts of the sky are covered by the retrieved
AORs.  See the section on <a href="details.html">the Details pane</A>
for more information on what is in each tab, and the section on  <a
href="visualization.html">visualization</A> for more information on
the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 

You can also search all of the SSC-developed Enhanced Products or the 
Contributed Enhanced Products returned to the SSC and IRSA (largely
contributed by the Legacy teams).  Each team delivered different
products, ranging from images, catalogs, and spectra to images beyond
the Spitzer bands.  See <a href="searching.html#enhanced">the enhanced
products</A> discussion in the searching section for more
information.<P>

After deciding what data to download, click the checkboxes on the far
left of each row to pick specific data files to download, and then
click "Prepare Download" to begin the  packaging and downloading
process.  A pop-up window will appear in order to define exactly what
kinds of data you would like to have packaged up. Clicking OK
initializes this process.<P>

The Background Monitor appears as a link in the upper right of your
window to keep track of the data download.  A pop-up window can be
called up by clicking the "Background Monitor" link.  You can watch
your data being packaged, and when the data are available for
download, it will update that window, providing a link (or more than
one link) for downloading the packaged data. (<a
href="downloads.html">More on data downloads</A>.)<P>

<strong>Important note</strong>: don't log in while it is preparing a
download! If you log in during a download, as far as the system is
concerned, you have changed identities (from 'anonymous' to 'jones',
say), and as a result it does not complete preparing the download.<P>



<A NAME="searchHistory"><!-- --></A><H3>History/Tags -- Your search history and tag history</H3>

The History/Tags menu option gives you access to your own search
history and tag history.  By default, it comes up with the Search
History tab in the foreground; to access the Tag History, just
click on the "Tags" tab.<P>

<DL>
<DT><em>Your Search History</em><P>

<DD>All of the searches that you do for a given session with the archive
are remembered in the search history panel. A high-level summary of
the search is also listed -- what kind of search it was, what
parameters you used, and the number of AORs or IERs that it
returned.<P>

You can resubmit the search (see buttons at top left of the search
history tab), remove the search from your history, or save the search
as a favorite search to which you can return at a later time/date.
(However, you do need to be logged in when you save the search -- <a
href="user.html">more on user registration</A>.) <P>

<DT><em>Tags and Your Tagging History</em><P>

<DD>Many of the papers published on Spitzer data include a
list of all the individual AORKEYs (the integer number corresponding
uniquely to each AOR) used for data discussed in that paper.  This
provides an easy way for readers to retrieve the data from the Spitzer
archive, and links can be made from ADS directly back to the SHA.<P>

However, many papers use many AORs.  Data tagging allows you to
customize the data set you use so that the link back from ADS (or
embedded in your paper itself) refers to a single unique identifier
that corresponds to all your data. (That is, a single identifier, as
opposed to a potentially long list of AORKEYs.)<P>

Once you have established a search that you like, you can click on the
"Tag It" icon in the top right of the search results tabs. It will then ask
for a nickname, and then return the tag name for insertion into your
paper as well as a direct URL you can distribute. <P>

Once you have tagged a search, it appears in the "Tags" tab.<P>

</DL>

<a NAME="readfitsfile"><H3>Read FITS file -- Reading in
FITS files</h3></A>

Powerful visualization tools were important to the original Spitzer
observation planning and archive tools (Spot and Leopard), and the
descendents of these tools are included in the SHA.  These tools can
be used to investigate images of any sort, from your disk or from a
variety of online resources, at IRSA or another website.<P>

Selecting the "Read FITS File" option from the blue tabs on top of the
SHA window results in a large visualization window, into which you can
load images from a variety of sources. A pop-up window appears with
the available image options. Please see the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> for much more
information about the visualization environment, specifically what the
icons mean.  (Hovering with your mouse over an icon will also reveal a
"tool tip" to help figure out what each icon does.) <P>



<A NAME="preferences"><H3>Preferences -- Setting and using your preferences</H3></A>

The preferences tab provides a few ways to customize your 
experience.  The window that appears when you click that option
gives you by default a choice of the number of entries that appear in
the table by default, allows you to enter your email for an email
notification when data are packaged, and allows you to select the
default for distance measurements.<P>

<a href="user.html">Log in</A> before setting these preferences, and
they will be preserved for you the next time you log in.<P>

<A NAME="help"><H3>Getting Help</H3></A>

The "SHA Help" blue tab leads you into this online help, as does
"Spitzer Help" from under the "Help" in the IRSA menu on the top
of the SHA page. You can also download a PDF version of this manual;
look at the top of the help window for the "View PDF" link.<P>

For an even faster overview, see the <a
href="quickguide.html">Quick-Start Guide</A>.  For more detailed
information on any of these topics, see the rest of the more detailed
online help.<P>

Please see <a href="more.html">the section on more help</A> for more
information on getting more help, or contacting us.<P>

<A NAME="catalogs"><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3></A>

(Note that this blue tab is only available after you have performed at
least one search, e.g., you have something on which to overlay the
catalog.)<P> 

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs to load in
preparation for overlaying on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. First we cover catalogs
you can download from IRSA, then we cover <a href="#owncatalogs">using
your own catalogs</A>. There is much more information in <a
href="catalogs.html">the catalogs section</A> as well. <P>

By clicking on the "Catalog" menu option, a window appears with
several options, as follows.<P>

The target name is by default the one for the current search/AOR with
which you are working. If you would like to change the center of the
search for purposes of the catalog search, click on "modify target"
and enter the new information.  All of the same basic parameters as for a
position search of the SHA appear.<P>

You can then choose catalogs based first on the "project" under which
they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer (includes
delivered enhanced product catalogs), MSX, etc.  The options under the
"category" and the specific clickable catalog on the right change
according to the project you have selected.  A short description is
provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more information.<P>

<A NAME="catColumn"> You can also set restrictions on specific columns
by clicking on  "Set Column Restrictions".</A> A new window will open
up with the available  column names in the catalog, and you can filter
what is returned, with the same basic approach as in <a
href="results.html#filter">filtering your search results</A> in the
rest of the SHA. All the restrictions are  AND operators.<P>


Click on "Search" to initiate the search. <b>NOTE THAT</b> the search
may take a long time to return, especially if you have asked for a
large catalog, and you may think that nothing has happened, but be
patient and eventually it will either spin off to the background
monitor, or return a tab.<P>

If the catalog search is successful, it will return the results in a
tab of its own, in an interface similar to the other data tabs. You
can save the catalog to your local disk for future use. <P> 

If it does spin off to the <a
href="downloads.html#background">background monitor</A>, the monitor will
dynamically update to reflect its status, and will let you know when
the catalog is ready to download or display. Open the background
monitor and click on the catalog name to load it into a tab in the
SHA. <P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer.<P>


<a name="owncatalogs"><b>Loading your own catalogs</b><P></A>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for new catalogs. However, you can
pick another tab from the top left, "Load Catalog", to load your own
catalog.<P>

Your catalog needs to be in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

There is more information in <a href="catalogs.html">the catalogs
section</A>.<P> 



<A NAME="downloads"><H3>Downloads - Downloading data and the Background
Monitor</H3></A>

On any search results page, you can click the checkboxes on the far
left of each row to pick specific data files to download, and then
click "Prepare Download" (near the top of the column of checkboxes) to
begin the packaging (and downloading) process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking OK initializes this process.  <P>

To select <em>all</em> of the data you have displayed, click on the
checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes, and all of the rows
are automatically clicked (even those on subsequent pages).  Then
click "Prepare Download" to initiate the packaging process.<P>

The packaging process spins off into the <a
href="downloads.html#background">background monitor</A>, which keeps
track of its progress and notifys you when the downloads are
complete. You can choose to have an email sent to you to let you know
when things are ready. If you have just a few zip files, you can click
to download them, but especially if you have many files, you may want
to have the SHA generate a <a
href="downloads.html#downloadScript">downloading script</A> for you to
download them all automatically. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. <P>

For more information, see <a href="downloads.html">the section on
downloads</A>.<P>
