<h2>User Registration for the Spitzer Heritage Archive</h2>

While you certainly <b>do not have to register</b> to search the
archive, download data, analyze it, and write a paper, you may wish to
register so that the SHA remembers you and your preferences. <P>

On the other hand, <strong><em>if you have proprietary data, you will
need to log in</em></strong> so that the system grants you access to
your data. If you got email from the Spitzer Help Desk about account
information, you may already have an account; else you can set up an
account (see below).  Once you have set up an account, please send us
an email at the Spitzer Help Desk and we'll tie your new account to
your proprietary data.  <P>

Note that there is a single user account/password combination  for all
IRSA services, but that data access, preferences, search history, data
tagging, etc., are all unique to each archive.<P>
