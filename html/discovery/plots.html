<h2>Data Discovery Tool: Plots</h2>

Plots can be made from <a href="tables.html">Tables</A>, and plots are
made automatically in the Data Discovery Tool. Plotting is covered in
this section. The <a href="tables.html">Tables</A> section discusses
tables more generally. The <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> section covers intearcting
with images. <P>

<h3><a name="default">Default Plot</A></h3>

By default, after a catalog has loaded, a plot appears in the upper
right of your browser window.<P>

To obtain a full-screen view of your plot, click on the expand icon in
the upper right of the window pane when your mouse is in the window:
<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. To return to the prior view, click
the "Close" arrow in the upper left.<P>

The plotting tool in the Data Discovery tool, by default, has the
spectral energy distribution (SED) for your search target, pulled
either from  <a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/"
target="_blank">NED <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (works
best for extragalactic objects) or   <a
href="https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR"
target="_blank">VizieR <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. 
<P>

<h3><a name="firstlook">Plot format: a first look</A></h3>

<img src="img/nedsed.png" width="500"><BR> This is the SED that the
Data Discovery tool shows for Arp 220, with the data being retrieved
from NED.<P>

Letting your mouse hover over a point tells you the values of the
point under your cursor:<img src="img/nedsedonepoint.png"
width="200">. Clicking (in an unbinned plot)  highlights that point,
and it stays highlighted, though you must keep your mouse on the point
in order to see the information about how many points it
represents.<P>

<img src="img/viziersed.png" width="500"><BR> This is the SED that the
Data Discovery tool shows for HD 878, with the data being retrieved
from Vizier.<P>



<h3><a name="linking">Plot Linking:</A> Plots are linked to catalog and image(s)</h3>

If you move your mouse over any of the points in the plot, you will
get a pop-up telling you the values corresponding to the point under
your cursor. For scatter plots, if you click on any of the points, the
object(s) corresponding to that point will be highlighted in the SED
table -- you may need to click on the SED tab to bring it to the
foreground.  This works the other way too - click on a row in the SED
tab, and the object will be highlighted in the plot or the catalog or
the image.<P>

<h3><a name="orign">What is it Plotting?</A></h3>

The tool is plotting its best guess as to what the SED is of the
object. The y-axis is nuF_nu and the x-axis is wavelength in microns.
<P>

<strong>NED</strong> <P>

If it uses NED to translate the name of the object to RA/Dec, then it
will use NED data to get an SED. Very common names are resolved via
NED but may not have an SED in NED. Try "M101" to get an SED; try
"M16" to get the coordinates from NED but find no SED.<P>

The units from the points are what are supplied by NED. (note that the
carats are used in an on/off sense, e.g., erg s^-1^ cm^-2^ means ergs
per second per centimeter squared, where the first carat means
"superscript" and the second carat means "back to normal".)  No
additional translation has been done here, aside from multiplying to
get nuF_nu.<P>

The points that NED reports can come in a variety of units, but the
data are filtered down to only include those in units of Jy before
multiplying and plotting.<P>

<strong>VizieR</strong> <P>

If it uses SIMBAD to translate the name of the object to RA/Dec, then
it will use  VizieR to get an SED. Try the name of a star (like HD
878) to get an SED. <P>

The VizieR photometry tool allows for easy visualization of photometry
points extracted around a sky position from photometry-enabled
catalogues in VizieR. Even when an object name is used as a target,
what is returned is just a list of photometry point found within some
search radius, and should not be mistaken for an actual SED for the
target object: there is no guarantee that all photometry points
correspond to the target, especially for extended sources or stars in
a cluster in close (projected) proximity.<P>

Note that, for VizieR searches, an additional circle appears on the
image on the left; this is the search radius used to retrieve the
points from VizieR that are shown here.<P>



<h3><a name="changing">Changing what is plotted</A></h3>

To change what is plotted, click on the gears icon in the upper right
of the plot window pane: <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"
align="center">. Configuration options then appear; the options are a
little different than other plots in tools like this:<br>  <img
src="img/nedsedplotparameters.png" width="30%"> <br> <P>

You can see that it is doing manipulations to plot what is shown. The
magnifying glass is a link that brings up a table that lists all of
the available columns in the corresponding SED tab. Alternatively, you
can just start typing, and viable options appear below the box.
Whatever you put in the box must match the column name as shown in the
catalog <em>exactly</em>. <P>

Click on the triangle to open additional options for the layout. <P>

You can change the label and units as shown in the plot. <P>

You can enter <strong>simple mathematical relations</strong> in these
boxes.
Supported operators:
<UL>
<LI>+,-,*,/
<LI>abs(x), acos(x), asin(x), atan(x), atan2(x), ceil(x), cos(x),
exp(x), floor(x), lg(x), ln(x), log10(x), log(x), power(x,y),
round(x), sin(x), sqrt(x), tan(x)
<LI>Non-alphanumeric column names (e.g., those with - or + or similar
characters) should be quoted in expressions.
</UL>
<P>

You can enter the label for the axes, and choose whether or not a grid
is included on that axis, and whether or not the axis is reversed. <P>

By default, the boundaries of the plot are set to encompass the full
data range. Here you can change the boundaries to specific numbers.
(This can also be set via filtering from the plot; see below.)<P>

If you want a square or rectangular plot, you can change the x/y ratio
as displayed.<P>

Click "Apply" to apply, and "Close" to return to the plot without
making changes.<P>

In this plot, at the top of the plot options pop-up,  you can
control whether the points are shown as individual points, connected
points, or just a line. <P>

You can specify an error (either a column in the catalog, or
calculated from a column in the catalog). Those errors can be
symmetric or asymmetric (see pulldown menu). <P>

You can also change either axis to be linearly or logarithmically scaled.<P>



<h3><a name="restricting">Restricting What is Plotted</A></h3>

You can also restrict what data are plotted in any of several
different ways. <P>

You can set axis limits on the plot itself from the plot options
pop-up (discussed above).<P>

However, and perhaps more powerfully, you can set limits from the plot
itself using a rubber band zoom.  Click and drag in a sub-region of
the plot. A new icon appears in the upper right of the plot: <img
src="img/plotoptions.png">. This means "filter the catalog to leave
only those points encompassed by the selection in the plot." If you
click on the zoom icon, then the plot axes change to encompass just
the sources you have selected. If you click on the filter icon, then
the catalog view is filtered down, restricted to just those sources
you have selected, and the plot is zoomed in; the filter notes just
above the plot (and the above the table, as applicable) change to
remind you that you have a filter applied. Only those data points that
pass the filter are shown in the plot, in the table, and/or overlaid
on the image(s). (This is the behavior of 'filter', as opposed to
'select'; the former restricts what is shown, the latter just
highlights the points.) For more on filters, see <a
href="tables.html#filters">the filtering dicussion in the tables
section</A>.<P>


If you move your mouse over any of the points, you will get a pop-up
telling you the values corresponding to the point under your cursor.
If you click on any of the points, the object(s) corresponding to that
point will be highlighted in SED table.  This works the other way too
- click on a row in the SED table, and the object will be highlighted
in the plot.<P>

You can also zoom with your mouse on the plot -- do whatever you would
do with your mouse to scroll but with your mouse over the plot. You
can also grab-and-drag the plot axes to change the plotting range.<P>

<h3><a name="saving">Saving Plots</A> </h3>

Click on the diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">). Your plot will
then be saved as a png file. 
The saved PNG is the same size as it is on your screen. If you want a
big version, make the desired plot big on your screen (expand the view
to take up as much space as possible) before saving the PNG. <P>
