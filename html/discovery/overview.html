<h2>Data Discovery Tool: Overview</h2>

The Data Discovery Tool allows users to survey IRSA's holdings to see
what data (images, catalogs, spectra) overlap a position on the
sky.<P>

The results from this tool include a spectral energy distribution
(SED) obtained from either <a href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/"
target="_blank">NED <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (works
best for extragalactic objects) or   <a
href="https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR"
target="_blank">VizieR <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

The results from this search also include an option to pass the data
to <a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer/"
target="_blank">IRSA Viewer <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a different tool, or other tools at
IRSA.<P>


<h3>Searching</h3>

See <a href="searching.html">the searching section</A> for more
information on how to search.<P>


<h3>Results: Visualization</h3>

The images loaded into the visualizer appear in a 'window pane' in the
top left of the results of your search. <P> 

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization section</A> for
more on visualization.<P>

<h3>Results: Tables</h3>

Search results appear in an interactive table at the bottom of your
results. These tables can be sorted and filtered.  See <a
href="tables.html">the tables section</A> for more on tables.<P>

<h3>Results: Links in Tables</h3>

Search results within the tables can be loaded into other tools at IRSA, such as IRSA Viewer, Atlas, or tools specific to individual missions. Click on the link to launch the other tool, and consult that tool's documentation for more details.<P>


<h3>Results: Plots</h3>

A spectral energy distribution (SED) obtained from either <a
href="http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">NED <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (works best for extragalactic
objects) or   <a href="https://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR"
target="_blank">VizieR <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
appears in the upper right of your results.   See <a
href="plots.html">the Plots section</A> for more on plots.<P>
