<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the NASA Planck Archive
(NPA)</h2>


<dl>
<dt>What does NPA/ER/PR1/PR2/ERCSC/ESZ/ECC/PCCS/TOI mean?
<dd>Here are some common definitions. 
<ul>
<li>This is the NASA Planck Archive (NPA).</li>
<li>ER stands for the January 2011 ERCSC Release.</li>
<li>PR1 stands for the March 2013 Public Data Release 1.</li>
<li>PR2 stands for the February 2015 Public Data Release 2.</li>
<li>The ERCSC stands for the Early Release Compact Source Catalog. In
addition, there are two source catalogs based on multifrequency
detection algorithms which are included with the Planck ERCSC
release.  These are the Early  Release SZ Cluster Catalog (ESZ) and
the Early Release Galactic Cold Core catalog (ECC).</li>
<li>The PCCS (Planck Catalog of Compact Sources) is the single-band
catalog delivered as part of DR1.</li>
<li>TOI stands for Time Ordered Information, which are the individual
detector readings tagged by location on the sky, time and date
of observation, and the measured intensity.
</ul>

<dt>What's the file format that I need to use for the search-by-file
upload?

<dt>I did a search, left the NPA window up, and now that I've come
back to this session, it's in a funny state and does not appear to be
responding as it should. Why?
<DD>Sometimes, if there is a network hiccup (e.g., you pick up and
move your laptop to a different wireless hub), the NPA can be left in
a funny state.  Please restart your
session by reloading the NPA from scratch: <a
