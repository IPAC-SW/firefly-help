<h2>Searching the NASA Planck Archive (NPA)</h2>

There are basically three ways to search the NPA. <OL>
<LI><em>TOI</em> (time ordered information).  This option provides for
adding individual measurements of sky intensity together.
<LI><em>Browse catalogs</em>. This loads the entire catalog by
frequency and you can browse through it (or filter it) interactively.
In other words, this option searches a single wavelength, but all
positions.
<LI><em>Cutout visualization</em>. Search the multiple wavelength data
by position. In other words, this option searches a single position,
but all wavelengths.
</OL>
The default when loading the tool is the TOI search; other searches
can be accessed from the left hand side of the search window. <P>

You must search each delivery separately; PR2 is the latest and most
comprehensive, but PR1 and the ERCSC releases are also available.<P>

<a name="toi"><h3>Time Ordered Information (TOI) Search</H3></A>

TOI data consists of the measurements of the sky intensity obtained by
the Planck spacecraft as it spun at 1 revolution per minute. Each
measurement is tagged by the location on the sky that was pointed to,
the time of the observation, and whether or not a solar system object
was within the beam.<P>

Planck TOIs can be selected for download as FITS binary tables and for
display. The <b>TOI Search</b> page allows you to chose the TOIs you
want by location, frequency, specific detectors, and (optionally) by a
range of dates. <p>

These TOI have been pre-extracted from the entire-mission  <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release_2/toi/">PLA
files <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>. For ease of use, the data have already had offsets and
per-detector monopoles applied, and all flagged data removed (except
SSO [=Solar System Objects] if selected). Weights, calculated from the
RIMO (=Reduced Instrument Model), are supplied in the header for
correct combination of multiple detectors. <p>

Here is an example TOI search. The output of this search can be sent
to the Minimap tool. Minimap creates a 2D projection of the full map
at the specified location, for more details please see <a
href="results.html#toi">the Results page</a>.<P>

This search specifies a 2 degree square field centered on the Galactic
Center which is bright and exhibits some structure at these
frequencies. The query form requests a single object. We can enter the
position or as an object name to be resolved via NED or Simbad. We
enter the name of "Sgr A*" which is resolved by NED. We select a 2
degree square field. <p>

The <b>SSO Flag</b> selection has two choices, where "SSO" means
"Solar System Object."  'F' means we do not want TOI samples   in
which a bright Solar System object (the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, Neptune)  was within the detector beam.  'All' means we do
allow these data to be included.<P>
 
The Planck band is specified via the <b>Select Frequency</b>. The band
selection then populates the list of available detectors at that
frequency. We choose '70 GHz' and the 18M and 19S detectors for this
example.   <p>

In the <b>Optional Search Constraints</b> we set the start and end
dates to '2010-01-1' and '2010-12-31', respectively, thus choosing
only observations in calendar year 2010. <p>

The results of this search continue in the <a
href="results.html#toi">Results section</A>. <p>





<A NAME="byWavelength"><A NAME="byFrequency"><H3>Browse Catalog Search
-- Single Frequency Search (all-sky)</H3></A></A>

You may view any of the all-sky Planck catalogs including those based
on the multi-frequency detection methods and for each frequency band. 
Another way of thinking of this is searching a single frequency, but
all positions.<P>

To access this search option, selet "Browse Single [...] Catalogs" for
your desired release. Because it includes all of the mission data, PR2
is a good place to start if you have never done this before. <P>

The catalogs in each of the data releases can be selected with
the  pull-down menu from the search page, an example of which is given
below as a "callout" in the screen snapshot. <P>

<P><img src="img/singlefreq.png" width="100%"><P>

Content filtering on the all-sky catalog columns can be performed from
this point in the process by clicking on the  "Set Column Selections
and Filters" link. This pops up a window in which you can select
either the short or the long form for the catalog display (long form
has more columns), select the individual columns to be displayed, and
set constraints on individual column values (see <a
href="results.html#filter">Filtering</A> for more information).<P>

This search will return the rows of the catalog, selected by the input
parameters, together with preview images. The results are displayed
with the catalog and FITS cutout images.   The table has many columns
with positional, photometric, and size information about the source in
question. See the section on <a href="results.html">search
results</A>.<P>




<A NAME="byPosition"><H3>Cutout Visualization Search -- Multiple Frequency Search by Position</H3></A>

You may search by position across all of the Planck catalogs. 
Another way of thinking of this is searching a single position, but
across all frequencies.<P>

To access this search option, selet "Multiple Frequency Cutout
Visualization [...]" for your desired release. Because it includes all
of the mission data, PR2 is a good place to start if you have never
done this before.<P>

This is a position search. For this search, you may enter target
names, which will be automatically resolved into coordinates using NED
or Simbad. Alternatively, you may enter coordinates directly. These
coordinates can be in decimal degrees or in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.
By default, it assumes you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can
also specify galactic, ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>
Examples are given below the text entry box before you start typing in
the box.<P><P>

As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, it echoes back to you
what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which you
are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.  <P>

<P><img src="img/multifreq.png" width="100%"><P>

After the position, you need to enter the size of the cutouts you want
to see. <strong>Caution:</strong> pick your units from the pulldown
first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select
from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to
the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small.<P>

Next, you need to select which maps you want, and how you want the
Planck cutout image to be scaled. <P>

Then, you tell it which catalogs you want it to search, and the search
radius for those catalogs. Again, pick your units from the pulldown
first, and then enter a number.<P>

Click search to send it searching.<P>

A multi-frequency (position) search will return the rows of the
catalog, selected by the input parameters, together with preview
images. The results are displayed in tabs, and
each of these tabs correspond to the selected catalogs.   Each of
these tables has many columns with positional, photometric, and size
information about the source in question. See the section on <a
href="results.html">search results</A>.<P>


Note that, by default, these searches return a table of Planck
sources, but the table is <strong>not sorted by distance of a source
from the submitted coordinate</strong>.  To do that, you must click on
the column labeled "dist". The "dist" and the associated "angle" (for
Position Angle) columns are appended to the catalog column list so are
found at the far right. Scrolling is usually necessary to see these
columns. <P>
