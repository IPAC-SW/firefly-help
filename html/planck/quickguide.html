<b>What is available via this tool?</b> This interface primarily
provides an interactive way of exploring Planck images and the most
commonly used catalogs. All-sky catalogs are available for each of the
9 frequency ranges (30 - 857 GHz)</b> covered by Planck. These have
not been merged into a single multi-wavelength catalog. However, if
you are interested in an individual source, you can search for that
source in all of the Planck catalogs at once using this tool. Tangent
plane projected Planck cutouts at the location of the source are
available in this visualization tool. WMAP and IRAS images are also
provided for individual sources.<P>

You can also simply download the entire catalogs either via this
interface or via the <a

target="_blank">mission page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <P>

<b>Data releases:</b> The Planck data releases come in three batches,
which are (in reverse chronological order): (1) Planck Public Data
Release 2 (PR2); (2) Planck Public Data Release 1 (PR1); (3)  Planck
ERCSC (Early Release Compact Source Catalog) Release.  All the
catalogs and pointers to documentation can be found <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/planck.html"
target="_blank">linked here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <p>

<b>Searching:</b> There are three kinds of searches in
the NPA. (1) TOI (Time Ordered Information); (2) Browse catalogs (a
single frequency at a time, but all positions); (3) cutout
visualization (a single position at a time, but all frequencies).  See
the section on <a href="searching.html">searching</A> for more
information.<P>

<b>Time Ordered Information (TOI):</b> TOI consists of the
measurements of the sky intensity obtained by the Planck spacecraft as
it spun at 1 revolution per minute. Each measurement is tagged by the
location on the sky that was pointed to, the time of the observation,
and whether or not a Solar System object was within the beam. TOI data
are available as of PR2.<P>

The terms <em>"source lists"</em> and <em>"catalogs" </em> refer to
both the single frequency and multi-frequency derived catalogs. <P>

SZ catalogs refer to the Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster
sample.<P>

PCCS catalogs refer to the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources.<P>

<!-- <LI> The ER also includes Early Release SZ (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich)
Cluster catalog (ESZ) and  the Early Release Galactic Cold Cores
catalog (ECC) which are based on multifrequency detection algorithms.
This  makes a total of 11 catalogs available as part of the ER.<p>

<LI> PR1 includes the 9 single-band source catalogs and four catalogs
derived from multi-frequency SZ cluster detection  algorithms:  SZ
MMF1, SZ MMF3, SZ PwS, and SZ Union [their union].  Only the SZ Union
cluster catalog is available in the visualization  tool. DR1 does not
include an updated Cold Cores catalog.
<P>

<LI> PR2 provides new PCCS, SZ, and Cold Cores catalogs available for download only. The
PR1 PCCS contents are used in the PR2 visualization pages.

<b>Search Results:</b> The search results can appear in up to a dozen
tabs, often with associated images. (See the section on <a
href="results.html">understanding your search results</A> for more
information.)<P>

<b>Filtering:</b> Filters, either imposed on your initial search or
via <a href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down search results to the observations you
want.<P>

<b>Visualizing:</b>  <a href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> is
a powerful tool for deciding what data to download.<P>

<b>Downloading Data:</b> Click on the diskette icon to save any
catalog you currently have loaded. Alternatively, click on the
checkboxes and then click "Prepare Download" to begin packaging your
data for download in the background. See <a href="downloads.html">the
section on Downloads</A> for more information.<P>
