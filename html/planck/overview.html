<h2>NASA Planck Archive (NPA): Overview</h2>

The NASA Planck Archive (NPA) is the final United States repository
for all of the data collected by the joint European Space Agency/NASA
Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation mission, Planck.  Only Planck
data that have been released to the public are available via this
interface.  <P>


<h3>The Spacecraft and Instruments</h3>

The Planck Telescope, consisting of a 1.5-meter telescope and two
science instruments, was launched into an L2 orbit on May 14, 2009,
and deactivated in October 2013. 
Planck performed a detailed study of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). The instruments aboard Planck --- the Low Frequency
Instrument (LFI)  and High Frequency Instrument (HFI) --- obtained
images at wavelengths between 30 and 857 GHz, with spatial resolution
ranging from 5 arcminutes at the shortest wavelengths to 33 arcminutes
at the longest. More information on Planck can be found at <a

<h3>Planck Mission</h3>

Mission Milestones include:
<ul>
<li>Launch: May 2009</li>
<li>Start of First All-Sky Survey: August 2009</li>
<li>End of Nominal Mission: November 2010</li>
<li><b>ERCSC Release</b>: January 2011</li>
<li>End of HFI lifetime: January 2012</li>
<li><b>Public Data Release 1</b>: March 2013</li>
<li>End of LFI lifetime and spacecraft deactivated: October 2013</li>
<li><b>Public Data Release 2</b>: February 2015 (updates 8/15, 12/15)</li>
</ul>
The primary sources of Planck data accessible by the NPA web tool are
the Planck ERCSC Release (ER), Planck Public Data Release 1 (PR1), and
the Planck Public Data Release 2 (PR2).  The ERCSC Release is based on
data acquired through 6 June 2010, Public Data Release 1 is based on
the Nominal Mission data, and Public Data Release 2 is based on the
complete mission data.

<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

The NASA Planck Archive provides several options for searching its
holdings.  There are basically three kinds of searches in the NPA. (1)
TOI (time ordered information); (2) Browse catalogs (single frequency
but all positions); (3) cutout visualization (single position but all
wavelengths).  See the section on <a
href="searching.html">searching</A> for more information.<P> <P>

The search results are displayed on the screen in three main regions:
(1) upper left: up to a dozen tabs,  one each for the nine Planck bands
from 30-857 GHz and the remainder for the multifrequency (Cold Cores
and/or SZ Cluster) catalogs. (2) upper right: details on the row
selected in the tabs; (3) bottom: image cutouts for the row selected
in the tabs. See the page on <a href="results.html">understanding your
search results</A> for more information.<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing search results to the observations you
want.  For example, you can restrict your search based on source flux
density or morphology, or you can restrict the entries in the tabs to
be just those objects observed more than, say, three times.<P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

After searching the Time Ordered Information (TOI) data, you can
combine subsets of the data into a new image.  See <a
href="results.html#toi">the Results section</a> for further details.
You can explore the image in the same way as you can explore any other
image in the NPA. (See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization
section</A> for more information.) <p>

After searching by "Browse Catalogs" (search by wavelength) or "Cutout
Visualization" (search by position), the NPA displays FITS images of a
small area around each object. These are shown below the search
results table, with the catalog entry highlighted in green and the
object centered in the field of view  for each wavelength.    PR1 and
PR2 visualization queries allows the image size to be set between 10
arcminutes and 2.0 degrees.  WMAP and IRAS FITS images, where
available, may also be shown for each table entry. (The original ERCSC
images are JPGs, not FITS, but the WMAP and IRAS images returned for
an ERCSC visualization search are indeed FITS files.) See <a
href="visualization.html">the visualization section</A> for more
information.<P>

<!--For the original ERCSC
Release, the cutout sizes are four times the  Planck beam FWHM in each 
band. Since there is a factor of 7 change in the FWHM between the 30
GHz and 857 GHz data, there will be different-sized images for each
wavelength. --> 

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

If you would like to download catalogs, click on the diskette
icon in the upper right of the catalogs tab. It will save the file as
an IPAC table file.  The entire catalog will be saved if you are in
the "browse catalog" kind of search; just the retrieved sources will
be saved if you are in the "cutout visualization" kind of search. <P>

If you'd like to download FITS data, click on the checkbox on the
upper left side of the corresponding images or to the left of the
corresponding row.  Next, click "Prepare Download" to begin the 
packaging and data download process. The data will be made into a
downloadable package by a background job, which can notify you via
email when it's finished.  <P>

See <a href="downloads.html">the Downloads section</A> for more
specific information on how to select data for download. See <a
href="basics.html#download">the section on the Background Monitor</A>
for more information specifically on the background monitor.<P>

<h3>User Login</h3>

The archive can remember you when you return. See the <a
href="user.html">user registration section</A> for more
information.<P>
