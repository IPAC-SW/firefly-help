<A NAME="terminology"><H3>Planck Mission</H3></A>

The Planck Telescope observes the entire sky at frequencies ranging
from 30 - 857 GHz.  The releases of Planck data include:
<UL>
<LI> all-sky maps;
<LI>a set of source catalogs in each of the wavelength ranges
characteristic of Planck's instrument complement; 
<LI>a collection of
source catalogs, including those based on the multi-band detection of
cold cores and SZ clusters;
<LI>TOI information (measurements of the sky intensity as a function
of time).
</UL>
Users have full access to the Planck catalogs through this tool, and
the archive enables sorting and selection of columns of data
characteristics.  <P>


<A NAME="searching"><H3>Searches -- The basics of searching</H3></A>


There are basically three ways to search the NPA. (1) <em>TOI</em>
(time ordered information); this option provides for adding individual
measurements of sky intensity together. (2) <em>Browse catalogs</em>;
since Planck observations cover the entire sky, this option loads the
entire catalog by frequency and you can browse through it
interactively (e.g., all positions, but one wavelength).  (3)
<em>Cutout visualization</em>; search the  multiple frequency data by
position (e.g., all wavelengths, but one position). The default when
loading the tool is the TOI search; other searches can be accessed
from the left hand side of the search window.  

After a search, you can perform additional searches
via clicking on the "Searches" blue tab at top left. <P>

For <em>TOI searches and Visualization searches</em>, you enter a position
anywhere in the sky. You may enter target names, which will be
automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or Simbad.
Alternatively, you may enter coordinates directly. These coordinates
can be in decimal degrees or in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format. By default,
it assumes you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can also specify
galactic, ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>
Examples are given below the text entry box before you start typing in
the box.  As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, it echoes back to you
what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which you
are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.  <P>

For the <em>browse catalog searches</em>, the simplest initial option is to
just ask it to load the catalog at any given frequency. It will then
load the catalog for you, enabling you to browse it. You can impose
filters from the search page or after the catalog has loaded; see <a
href="results.html#filter">filtering information</A>.<P> 

A visualization search (multi-wavelength, positional search) will
return the rows of the catalog selected by the input parameters,
together with preview images. In the lower portion of the NPA window,
images will appear in FITS format: data from Planck (JPEG images only
in the ERCSC Release), WMAP, and IRAS will be shown. See the section
on  <a href="visualization.html">visualization</A> for more
information on the options within the visualization tabs.<P> 

Searching is described in detail <a href="searching.html">in the
section on searching</A>,  results are discussed in <a
href="results.html">the section on results</A>, and downloading data
is discussed in <a href="downloads.html">the section on downloads</A>.<P>

You may wish to impose additional filters on your search results; see
<a href="results.html#filters">the section on filtering search
results</A> for more information.<P>



<A NAME="searchHistory"><H3>History -- Your search history</H3></A>

The History menu option (blue tab at the top of the window, next to 
"Searches") gives you access to your own search history. <P>

All of the single-position searches that you perform during a given
session with the NPA are remembered in the search history
panel. A high-level summary of the search is also listed -- what kind
of search you performed and which parameters you used.<P>

You can resubmit the search (see buttons at top left of the search
history window), remove the search from your history, or save the
search as a favorite search to which you can return at a later
time/date. However, in order to return to it during a different
session, you do need to be logged in when you save the search -- see
the <a href="user.html">user registration section</A>. <P>

<!-- no batch searches possible. Note that batch searches are not
retained, even if you log in and attempt to save them.<P> --!>

<A NAME="catalogs"><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using
catalogs</H3></A>
<a name="owncatalogs"><!-- --></A>

(Note that this blue tab is only available after you have performed at
least one search.)<P> 

You can choose from any of a wide variety of additional <a
href="catalogs.html">catalogs</A> to load and
overlay on your <a href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>.
They can be <A href="catalogs.html#irsacatalogs">catalogs from
IRSA</A> or your own <A href="catalogs.html#owncatalogs">catalogs from
disk</A>.  You can also make <a href="catalogs.html#xyplots">plots
from the catalogs</A>.<P>

For more on catalogs, see <a href="catalogs.html">the Catalogs
section</A>.



<a name="Backgroundmonitor"> <A NAME="download"><H3>Background Monitor
-- Downloading data and catalogs in the background</H3></A></a>

For information about downloading data (e.g., how to initiate it),
please see the <a href="downloads.html">Downloads section</A>. <P>

The Background Monitor appears as a blue tab (or button) in the upper
right of your window to keep track of the data downloads you have
requested.  It actively changes to reflect what it is doing
("Preparing", etc., e.g.,: <img src="img/preparing.png">) All data
packaging all goes to the Background Monitor; larger catalog requests
are also sent to the Background Monitor.  <P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" tab.  You can watch your data or catalog being
retrieved. It will update that window when the data are available for
download and overlay on your image, providing a link for obtaining the
data. It also keeps track of the downloads you have requested during
the same session, and indicates with a checkmark those that you have
already loaded. Remove them from the list by clicking on the blue 'x'.
<br> <img src="img/backgroundpopup.png"><P>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign") that appears next to the query in the Background Monitor
pop-up.<P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Add
email" (or "change email") from the lower right of the Background
Monitor popup and add (or change) your email during the packaging
process. <P>

The Background Monitor will also keep track of catalog downloads
for you. The monitor will dynamically update to reflect its status,
and will let you know when the catalog is ready to download or
display. Open the background monitor and click on the catalog name to
load it into a tab of its own. For more on catalogs, see the <a
href="catalogs.html">Catalog section</A>. <P>

<em>Selecting Data to Download</em><P>

There are basically two ways to download data -- clicking a diskette
icon or selecting tickboxes and selecting "Prepare Download."  <P>

The
diskette icon (<img src="img/save.png">) can save only the current
image (if selected from the <a href="visualization.html#toolbox">image
toolbox</A>) or just the current catalog (if selected from the upper
right of any catalog window). <P>

If checkboxes appear in the upper left of images or on the far left
hand side of a row in a catalog, you can select multiple items for
packaging and download; additional data come with this packaged
download.  After deciding which data to download, click the checkboxes
to select specific data files, and then click "Prepare Download" to
begin the packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up window will
appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you would like to
have packaged up. Clicking "Prepare Download" in the pop-up
initializes this packaging process.<P>

After you click "Prepare Download", the packaging process moves to 
the Background Monitor.  The background monitor can be called up by
simply clicking on the blue tab.  You can watch your data being
packaged, and when the data are available for download, it will update
that panel, providing a link for downloading the packaged data. Your
most recent download request appears on the top of the list. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. Look for a
"Downloads" folder or search for recently modified files. <P>

For more specifics on how to download data, see <a
href="downloads.html">the Downloads section<A>.<P>
