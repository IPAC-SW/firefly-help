<h2>Catalog Search Tool: Overview</h2>

The Catalog Search Tool allows users to search IRSA's catalogs
using potentially complex constraints. These queries can be built
using either a web-based interface (which is most of what is covered
by this documentation) or a <a href="api.html">program interface</A>.

The catalogs are stored as two-dimensional tables. Each row represents a record of the information for an individual source, such as a point-source in a catalog of point sources. Each column holds one datum or item of information about the source, such as position, magnitude, quality flags and so on.<P>

Information in a database is accessed with the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">Structured
Query Language (SQL) <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>, a
syntax optimized for database tasks. SQL queries are interpreted by a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database"
target="_blank">Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, the
engine that manages and organizes information in a database. While SQL
is an easy language to master, complex queries are long and tedious to
debug. The Catalog Search Tool shields users from the need to write
SQL by providing a web-based form that allows users to build their
query interactively. The Catalog Search Tool builds an SQL query based
on the user's requests, launches it, and writes the retrieved data to
an ASCII file for download. Complex search constraints can be quickly entered and run. <P>

 

<h3>Searching</h3>

See <a href="searching.html">the searching section</A> for more
information on how to search.<P>


<h3>Results: Visualization</h3>

The images loaded into the visualizer appear in a 'window pane' in the
top left of the results of your catalog search. <P> 

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization section</A> for
more on visualization.<P>

<h3>Results: Tables</h3>

Search results appear in an interactive table at the bottom of your
results. These tables can be sorted and filtered.  See <a
href="tables.html">the tables section</A> for more on tables.<P>


<h3>Results: Plots</h3>

Plots from your catalog search results appear in the upper right of
your results.  See <a href="plots.html">the Plots section</A> for more
on plots.<P>


<h3>API</h3>

You can also interact with the Catalog Search Tool from code you
write, e.g., the application programming interface (API).  See <a
href="api.html">the API section</A> for more on that.<P>
