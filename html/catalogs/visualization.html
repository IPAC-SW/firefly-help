<h2>Catalog Search Tool: Visualization</h2>

Once you have launched the visualizer portion of the application, a
window appears with an image pane that populated with an image related
to your search or selection. The image that is displayed is a real
image,  not a lossy-compressed representation of the image. You can
view FITS or HiPS files.<P>

<h3><A NAME="fitsViewer">FITS/HiPS Image Viewer</A></h3>

You can interactively explore the image with the mouse. Move your
mouse over any image that is loaded into the viewer. Details about the
image and, specifically, the pixel beneath your mouse cursor, appear
along the top right of the browser with a variety of useful items. Some
information is updated in real time (such as coordinates); some
information (such as flux densities) is updated when you stop moving
your mouse for a second or two.  The image can be interactively
investigated in this fashion.  <br> <img src="img/pixelreadoutCST.png"><br>
You can make it 'stick' on a particular place on the image -- tick the
"Lock by click" box and then click on the image at your desired
location. <P>

The upper left of the loaded image tells you basic things about the
image you are viewing. The telescope and/or instrument and/or channel
and/or data release is in black. The field of view is in green font;
this corresponds to the (horizontal) width of the image window.<P>

<img src="img/iraclabel.png"> An example
of image labels. This is from Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products
(SEIP), IRAC channel 2, and the field of view is 11 arcmin. <P>

<H3><A NAME="imageinfo">Image Information</A></H3>


The upper left of the loaded image tells you basic things about the
image you are viewing. The telescope and/or instrument and/or channel
and/or data release is in black. The field of view is in green font;
this corresponds to the (horizontal) width of the image window.<P>

<img src="img/iraclabel.png"> <img src="img/uvlabel.png"> Two examples
of image labels. The former is from Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products
(SEIP), IRAC channel 2, and the field of view is 11 arcmin. The latter
is far-ultraviolet (FUV) data delivered by the Local Volume Legacy
(LVL) project, and the field of view is 6.8 arcmin.<P>

<img src="img/multiplanelabel.png"> Images can have multiple planes;
the blue arrows shown here allow you to page through the planes. (This
is from the HerMES project and is Herschel SPIRE 350 micron data.)<P>


For HiPS images, the FOV is is the angular size of the width of the HiPS
viewer. Even if the image as displayed is smaller than the window, the
FOV readout is the width of the window, not the image.  If you shrink
your browser screen, the FOV can get smaller because the viewer gets
smaller. If you load more than one image, the FOV can get smaller
because two viewers must fit in the same pane. As a result, the HiPS
FOV requested in the search panel are approximate.<P>

For FITS images, the FOV label on FITS images works analogously to the
FOV label on HiPS images. If you zoom out, the FOV will increase even
when the FITS image is entirely within the viewer. That's because the
FOV is what the viewer can show you based on the pixel size. If you
drag the image so that it is only partially seen through the viewer,
the FOV will not change. For FITS images, the cutout size is not the
same as the FOV. <P>

The target on which you searched is overlaid on the main image with a
cross-hair marker:<img src="img/target.png"> You can remove this (or
change its color) from the layers pop-up, described below.<P>

Some information (like the title of the image) is also given
in the interactive exploration region described immediately above.
This region also includes additional information about the image (such
as the pixel scale and orientation).<P>



<a name="imageoptions"> <!-- --> </A>
<h3><a name="toolbar">Image Toolbar (FITS and HiPS)</A></h3>

When you place your mouse over the image in the upper left of the
Catalog Search Tool results, you get some icons that appear in the
upper right of the image. Click on the one that looks like this: <img
src="img/gettoolbox.png"> and you will reveal the Image Toolbox:<br>
<img src="img/toolboxCST.png" width="100%"><br> from which you can
select a variety of options, now described.  Letting your mouse hover
over any of these icons will result in a "tool tip" that appears in
order to remind you what the icon does. This information is also
dynamically updated on the bottom of the toolbox itself. <strong>Most
items apply equally to FITS and HiPS images, but some (e.g., the color
table/stretch) only apply to FITS images.</strong><P>

<DL>

<A NAME="fitsDownloadOptions"><!-- --></A>

<dt><img src="img/save.png"> <em>Saving the image.</em>
<dd>The diskette icon will allow you to save the current image.  You
can save files to your local disk or to the  <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  Note that
<b>you</b> control where the file is saved on your disk through your
browser; your browser may be configured to
store all downloads in a particular location on your disk.<P>

If the current image is a FITS file, you can save it as a FITS or PNG
or regions file to your local disk. If it is a HiPS file, your only
choices are PNG or regions file. Saved FITS images will not save the
color stretches or overlays; it will just save the underlying FITS
image.  Saved PNG files WILL include any overlays or annotations you
have placed on the image, but will not include the underlying FITS
image. Saved regions files will not save the underlying image, but
will just save the overlays as a DS9 Regions file. See the <a
href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html" target="_blank">DS9
website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for more information on the syntax of these DS9 region
files. <P>

Note that you can save the original or a cropped version of a FITS
file; see the "select region" icon below to crop, then click on the
save icon. Be sure to save the cropped FITS image (see annotated
figure). This feature is not available for HiPS images.<br> <img
src="img/savecropped.png"> <P>

The Catalog Search Tool, by default, overlays the catalog on the
image.  If your catalog consists of tens of thousands of sources, and
you  save a regions file from the catalog overlay, then you will have
fewer sources in the regions file than you have in the full
catalog.<P> 

<a name ="newimage">  </A>
<dt><img src="img/selectnew.png"> <em>Selecting a new image.</em>  
<dd>Click on this icon to add a new image through a new search, or to
change the current image to a new image. The window you obtain looks
like this:<br>
<img src="img/searchCST.png" width="80%"><br>
Your options are:
<UL>
<LI>View FITS Imges -- replace the image with another FITS image 
<LI>Create 3-color Composite -- replace the image with a composite of
three FITS images (more on this <a
href="basics.html#3-color">elsewhere in the online help</A>)
<LI>View HiPS images -- Replace the image with a HiPS image (more on
this <a href="basics.html#hips">elsewhere in the online help</A>)
</UL>
<P>
Searching from this point is straightforward, and works <a
href="basics.html#searching">just like in the main IRSA Viewer
component</A> of the tool.  <P>


<dt><img src="img/zoominout.png"> <em>Zooming in or out.</em>  
<dd>
Clicking on these magnifying glass icons zooms in or out of the image.
The readout of the net effect of your zooming on the displayed field
of view (FOV) appears at the top left of each image, in green.  <P>

If you click zoom in or out rapidly, a pop-up window appears to allow
you to more rapidly select the zoom level (field of view) you want.
Select the desired level, or click on the 'x' in the upper right to
make the window go away. Here is an example: <br><img
src="img/zoomlevel.png"><P>

Note that there is a maximum (or minimum) allowed zoom level, and they
are different for FITS and HiPS images. A notification will appear
when you have reached the maximum (or minimum) allowed zoom level for
a given image.  To enlarge things more (or less) than that, please
repeat your search to obtain new images with smaller (or larger)
spatial extent. HiPS images are specifically designed for large areas,
so if you need a big area, use HiPS. If you want to zoom in close
enough to see individual pixels, your best choice is FITS. <P>

See also the section below on <a href="#changing">changing coverage
images</A>, specifically that on automatic transitions while
zooming</A>. <P>


<dt><img src="img/zoomoriginalsize.png"> <em>Zooming to a 1-to-1 size.</em>  
<dd> Clicking this icon will zoom the image such that one pixel in the
image is one pixel on your screen. This option is only available with
FITS images; HiPS images by their nature have pixels of varying sizes,
so this button has no meaning in this case.  <P>


<dt><img src="img/fitandfill.png"> <em>Fit image to screen or fill
screen</em>  
<dd>
These two icons are designed to maximize the available space in your
browser window. The first one automatically picks a zoom level such
that the image entirely fits within the available space. The second
one automatically picks a zoom level such that the image fills as much
of the available space as possible (e.g., it is zoomed such that short
axis of the window is filled with the image, whether that short axis
is left-right or up-down). <P>

By default, the images that are returned are frequently but not always
centered on your search target. Clicking on these icons let you see
the whole image that is returned, whether or not it is centered on
your target. <P>

This is available for both FITS and HiPS images, though note that FITS
images retrieved from IRSA using this tool are typically square, and
HiPS images cover the sky, so fitting the image to the screen
might not be what you want to do. <P>

<dt><img src="img/colortable.png"> <em>Changing the color table.</em>
<dd>This icon enables you to change the color table of the
displayed image. (This option is only available for FITS, not HiPS,
images.)  When you click the button, a pull-down menu appears
with a wide variety of color table choices. Select your new color
table from the options shown:<br>
<img src="img/colortableoptions.png"><P>

<dt><img src="img/stretch.png"> <em>Changing the color stretch.</em> 
<dd>This icon enables you to change the color stretch of the displayed
image. (This option is only available for FITS, not HiPS, images.) 
For much more information, please <a
href="visualization.html#stretches">see below</A>.<P>


<A NAME="rotateImage"><!-- --></A>
<dt><img src="img/rotate.png"> <em>Rotating the image to any
angle </em> 
<dd>This feature allows you to rotate the image about the displayed
center of your image to any angle of your choice, in degrees. (This
option is only available for FITS, not HiPS, images.) It will rotate
the image counter-clockwise (to the left) East of North if the image
has a WCS embedded in it. <br><img src="img/rotatepopup.png"><br> You
can type a number in the "angle" box, or use the slider, to rotate the
image. To bring it back to North-up, click on the "North up" icon in
the pop-up or in the main image toolbar.  To exit the pop-up without
making further changes, hit the 'x' in the upper right of the
pop-up.<P>

<dt><img src="img/northup.png"> <em>Rotating the image so that North is
up</em>.  
<dd>Images retrieved via the Catalog Search Tool are commonly already
oriented such that North is up, or close to it. However, when
interactively investigating images, or loading images from other
sources, you could find yourself in a situation where North is not
necessarily up. Clicking this icon will orient the selected image so
that North is up. (This option is only available for FITS, not HiPS,
images.)  <P>

<dt><img src="img/flip.png"> <em>Flipping the image on the y-axis</em>.  
<dd>Clicking on this icon flips the image on the y-axis. (This option
is only available for FITS, not HiPS, images.) <P>

<dt><img src="img/recenter.png"> <em>Re-center the image.
</em>
<dd> Clicking this icon produces a pull-down menu:<br>
<img src="img/recenterpulldown.png"><br>
By default, "Pan by table row" is turned on. If you have an image
loaded that does not cover your whole search area, as you scroll
through your catalog, the FITS image underneath will move as needed
when you have selected an observation in a different part of the sky
than was originally shown.<br> <strong>Example of "Pan by table row"
functionality:</strong> Load the tool, any target, any catalog, but
make it at least 20 arcmin in radius. When it returns, click on the
"FITS" button above the image to force it to have an image smaller
than your search radius. Click on one of the sources on the far right
(west) of your RA/Dec plot. Note how the image changes. Click on one
of the sources on the far left (east) of your RA/Dec plot. Note how
the image changes again. <P>

Other choices are to center on the target of the observation, center
the image in the window, or center on a target of your choice. For the
last of those, you can simply center on that target, or center and
leave a marker on the image at that location.<P>

<dt><img src="img/selectregion.png"> <em>Selecting a region.</em>
<dd>When you click this icon, you are right away given a choice of a
rectangular selection or an elliptical selection. After you make that
choice, at first, nothing seems to happen. But, now you can click and
drag in the image, selecting a box or an ellipse on the image.  This
region can be resized by grabbing and dragging the corners of the box
or the pixels delineating the corners of a box around your ellipse.
You can make a new box right away by holding down the shift key and
clicking and dragging to select a new box.  When you have selected a
region of the image, additional icons appear above the image, and
exactly which icons you see is a function of whether you are working
on a FITS or HiPS image: <img
src="img/selectoptions.png"> These icons will allow you to (from left
to right):
<UL>
<LI>(FITS only) crop the image to the selected region (then you can save the
cropped FITS image via the save icon described above);
<LI>(FITS only) obtain statistics from the image on the region;
<LI>select the catalog sources overlaid on the image within
the region (highlights the sources in the list and plot);
<LI>filter the overlaid catalog down to the sources within the enclosed
area;
<LI>zoom the image to fit the selected area;
<LI>recenter the images on the selected area.
</UL>
You can save the cropped FITS image via the save icon (described
above).  The statistics option results in a pop-up that looks
something like this:<br><img src="img/imagestatistics.png"> <br> Note
that it calculates the location of the minimum and maximum fluxes, and
the aperture and flux-weighted centroids. If you put your mouse over
the row of the table in the pop-up, that location appears as an 'x' on
the image.  If you have a catalog overlaid, selecting sources with
this tool highlights them in the catalog list. You can choose to
impose a filter via this selection mechanism, the filters icon changes
above the catalog to indicate that there is a filter applied (<img
src="img/filtersapplied.png">). To clear the filters, click on the
cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">. There is much more on <a
href="tablesCST.html#columnsfilters">filters</A> in the tables
section.<P>

<strong>Note that</strong>, if you have a rotated FITS image such that
a crop would have to bisect pixels, it will show you the region that
encompasses your selection. If you crop at that point, then, it will
crop in image space (such that pixels are not bisected). See the
figure below -- in the original image, north is up. This has been
rotated 45 degrees. The selected region is in white. The yellow
dash-dot line is the crop in pixel space that encompasses the selected
region. <br> <img src="img/cropregion.png"><p>

<dt><img src="img/ruler.png"> <em>Measuring a distance.</em>
<dd>When you click this icon, at first, nothing seems to happen. 
However, you can now click and drag to draw a line on the image, and
the length of the line is displayed (in the middle of the line).   The
units for the measured distance (and the color of the overlay) can be
changed from the "layers" icon (described below). You can
calculate the difference in RA and Dec separately via the layers icon
as well; find the layer associated with the distance measurement and
tick the "offset calculation" box. When it displays the offset
calculation, it will give you the angle in degrees in one corner, and
the length of the line segment in the RA and Dec directions, in the
units you have specified. <P>

<dt><img src="img/marker.png"> <em>Put a marker on the image. </em>
<dd> When you click this icon, a pull-down menu appears with several
possible options:<br><img src="img/markeroptions.png"><br> The first
overlay choice (simply called 'marker') is a red circle. Initially, it
appears in the center of the images, and is meant to be moved to
wherever you first click in the image. It looks like this: <img
src="img/circlemarker.png">. The dash-dot line around it means that it
is 'active', so you can move (click and drag the marker) or resize it
(click and drag the dash-dot boundary).   You can change the color of
the marker (and change the label) via the "layers" icon (described
below). You can also remove this layer via the layers icon. There are
several additional options in the pulldown, enough that they have
their own <a href="#footprints">section below</A>.<P>

<dt><img src="img/compass.png"> <em>Add a compass rose</em> 
<dd> When you click this icon, arrows appear on the image showing
which direction is North and which is East.   (You can also remove
this layer via the layers icon, described below.)<P>

<dt><img src="img/coordinates.png"> <em>Add a coordinate grid.</em>
<dd>  Click on this icon to overlay a coordinate grid on the image.
(Only available for FITS images, not HiPS, but see information on HiPS
grid in the <a href="visualization.html#wcs">WCS section</A> of the
main IRSA Viewer documentation.)
Click it again to remove it. Customize the units of the grid (to,
e.g., Galactic coordinates) via the "layers" icon (described
below).<P>

<dt><img src="img/ds9icon.png"> <em>Read in a DS9 Regions file </em>
<dd> When you click this icon, you get a pop-up window from which you
can read in a DS9 regions file from your local disk. See the <a
href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html"
target="_blank">DS9 website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for more information on the syntax of
these DS9 region files. The supported regions are text, circle, box,
polygon, line, and annulus. To make this window go away without doing
anything, click on the 'x' in the upper right of the pop-up. <P>

<dt><img src="img/layers.png"> <em>Viewing/changing the layers on the
image.</em> 
<dd>If you've been following along by trying these various options,
you now have an image with a lot of annotations on it. The number that
appears in blue over the layers icon tells you at any given time how
many layers you have on the currently selected image. If you click
this icon, you will get a pop-up window with a list of all the layers
you have on top of the image. From the pop-up, you can turn layers off
and on, at minimum, but you can often also change exactly what is
displayed and what colors get used for it. To add new things, though,
you need to go to other options within the toolbar. Here is an example
of a well-populated layers pop-up. <br><img
src="img/layerspopup.png"><br> To change colors of a layer, click on
the 'colors' link to be taken to a new pop-up from which you can
select a new color. For catalogs or the search target, you can also
select the symbol shape and size:<br>
<img src="img/symbolpicker.png"><br> To adjust the size, type in the symbol
size in pixels or use the up/down arrow keys to change the size by one
pixel at a time. Click OK to implement your choices. 
To delete a layer, click on 'delete'. Some layers
appear do not have that option; to remove that layer, click on the
corresponding icon from which you added that feature. To make this
pop-up window go away, click on the 'x' in the upper right of the
pop-up. <P>

<dt><img src="img/lockedimages.png"><em>Lock/unlock image color tables

<dd>This icon has no effect on the images in the catalog search tool,
because only one image can be loaded at a time.<P>

<dt><img src="img/undoall.png"><em>Restoring everything to the

<dd>If you've played around a lot with the image, you may want to undo
everything you've done. Click this button to restore everything to

via the layers icon described above. <P>


<a name="viewingfitsheader"></A>
<dt><img src="img/fitsheader.png"> <em>Viewing the image header.</em>
<dd>This icon displays a pop-up window with information about the

the image; if a HiPS image is selected, it will show the HiPS
properties of the image. If you click on the columns in the pop-up, it
will sort the keywords alphabetically by that column. This is useful
for finding individual keywords in particularly densely populated FITS
headers. Click the header again to sort in reverse-alphabetical order,
and a third time to return to the default order. Below are examples of
an original and sorted FITS header.   To make this window go away,

<a name="stretches"><h3>Specific information on Color Stretches</h3></A>


<img src="img/stretch.png"> This icon enables you to change the color
stretch of the displayed image. (This option is only available for
FITS, not HiPS, images.) When you click the button, a pull-down menu
appears with a variety of choices. You can choose from a set of
pre-selected options:<br><img src="img/stretchoptions.png"><br> If you
pick the first one, "color stretch", you can customize the stretch. A
pop-up window appears with a histogram of the values in the image, and
you can change the stretch type and range. <br><img
src="img/customstretch.png"> <BR> If you pick a color stretch from the
pre-defined options, the pop-up window reflects this change. 

Example: pick 'Linear stretch to 99%'. Go back to "color stretch".
Note that it has filled out the stretch type and ranges to reflect the
current choice. Then -- either with the pop-up window still up or not
-- go back and pick a different pre-defined stretch from the standard
options. Note that the values in the pop-up change to reflect this
current choice.<P>


If you have a 3-color image, you can change the stretch in each color
plane separately; select the tab at the top accordingly for red,
green, or blue.  By default, it stretches each band independently, and
you can set the parameters in the stretch pop-up accordingly.<P>
<img src="img/3colorstretch.png"><P>

As described in <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2004PASP..116..133L" 
target="_blank">Lupton et al. (2004) <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, a different algorithm may be
useful for creating 3-band color images. Select "Hue preserving
stretch" to invoke this option. This stretch should be a
brightness-independent color-preserving asinh stretch, though in
practical terms, it seems to work best for optical images. <P>

<img src="img/luptonstretch.png"><P>

It may be useful to scale individual channels; sliders allow you to do
so. The Q parameter has another slider. For a linear stretch, Q=0;
increase Q to change what features are emphasized. Pedestal values can
also be set to allow the level assigned to "black" to change.<P> 


<a name="hipsViewer"><h3>Specific Information on HiPS Features</h3></A>
<a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A&A...578A.114F/abstract"
target="_blank">HiPS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (hierarchical progressive survey) images are
different than FITS images, and as such, the choices of what you can
do with the HiPS images are different than what you can do with the
FITS images. Choices you can make for HiPS images are sometimes
different than what you get for FITS images.<P>

The whole point of HiPS images is to provide on-demand resolution
changes. Zoom out, and it loads large pixels. Zoom in, and it loads
smaller pixels.  HiPS images are designed to cover large areas of sky
efficiently. If you need to visualize many degrees, this is the image
type to use.<P>

There are HiPS images from all over the world; the complete list of
HiPS images available from the IRSA Viewer search page includes (once
the "IRSA Featured" checkbox is unchecked) many HiPS images from <a
href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/" target="_blank">CDS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <P>

HiPS images have the color and stretch set by the person who
originally made them. Thus, you cannot change the color/stretch of
HiPS images from within IRSA Viewer. This is why there may be multiple
versions of some data sets in the list of HiPS images.<P>

You can't save HiPS images from within IRSA's tool. To download your
own copy, you will have to track down the original source of the
image.<P>


<a name="footprints"><h3>Footprints</h3></A>

The marker icon (<img src="img/marker.png">) has a pull-down menu with
several possible options:<br><img src="img/markeroptions.png"><br> Any
of the options with an arrow on the right can expand to additional
subsidiary choices, e.g.,:<br> <img src="img/markeroptionsp1.png"><br>
We now describe these various footprints here.<P>

For each of these choices, the markers appear initially in the center
of the loaded images. The first mouse click you make in any of the
images will move the marker to that location.<P>

Each of these marker choices, when overlaid and/or selected as
'active', has a dot-dash square around it. If it is asymmetrical (most
of them are), it has an additional "appendage" and a red plus at the
center of the footprint:<br> <img src="img/activeregion.png"><br>
These so-called "handles" allow you to resize and/or rotate the
marker, depending on the nature of the marker. These handles only
appear when the marker is selected as active; if you wait a few
seconds, they vanish.<P>

<strong>Troubleshooting and Tips:</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>Some of these footprints are <em>large</em>. If you have a small
image, some of these footprints will be larger than your image. Zoom
out to see it, or find a larger image to use. If you overlay, say, a
WFIRST footprint on a 2MASS image, you may need to zoom out a
considerable amount before you can see the WFIRST footprint. You will
see the center indicator of the marker before you will see the WFIRST
footprint itself. 
<LI>You can add multiple copies of the same marker using the layers
pop-up (described generally above).  From the layers pop-up, there is
a link right under the 'angle' option that says "Add [marker type]" --
click on that to get an additional marker of the same type. You can
also add a label to the marker from the layers pop-up, or change its
color.
<LI>If you have many footprints on the same image, you may have
trouble grabbing and moving footprints lower in the stack of layers on
the image. For example, overlay footprint 1, then footprint 2, and you
might have a hard time grabbing and rotating footprint 1 after
footprint 2 has been added. The only workaround here is to use the
layers pop-up (described generally above) to hide footprint 2, then
move footprint 1, then restore footprint 2.
<LI>If you have images of very different resolutions loaded
(e.g., IRAS and really anything else), sometimes it struggles to
render the marker on each image. You may need to place markers on one
image at a time. (Unclick the "lock overlays" button to place markers
one image at a time.)

<img src="img/circlemarker.png"> The first overlay choice (simply
called 'marker') is a red circle.   <P>

The remaining markers are all footprints from various telescopes:
Spitzer, SOFIA, HST, JWST, and WFIRST. HST, JWST and WFIRST are
derived from information provided via MAST (see <a
href="http://gsss.stsci.edu/webservices/footprints/help.html">http://gsss.stsci.edu/webservices/footprints/help.html <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)
For JWST and WFIRST in particular, they are pre-launch values.<P>

<img src="img/iracfoot.png"> <strong>Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron
footprints.</strong> These two footprints are placed separately
from each other. The footprint can be moved or rotated. Click and drag
the center of the footprint. A circle appears with four small circles
("handles") around it. Grab and drag the small circles to rotate it,
or drag the big circle to move it. Change the color, delete, or add
more copies of the IRAC footprints from the layers pop-up.<P> 

<img src="img/sofiafoot.png"> <strong>SOFIA footprints.</strong>

<img src="img/hst.png"> <strong>HST footprints.</strong>
You can overlay the whole focal plane footprint, shown here, or
individual instrument footprints (NICMOS, WFPC2, ACS/WFC, ACS/HRC,
ACS/SBC, WFC3/UVIS, and WFC3/IR).  Consult the <a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/apertures">HST
documentation  <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for specifics on which apertures are which. The
footprint can be moved or rotated. Click and drag the center of the
footprint. A circle appears with four small circles ("handles") around
it. Grab and drag the small circles to rotate it, or drag the big
circle to move it. <strong>Note that</strong> if you overlay the
footprint on a very small image, nothing will appear to have happened.
You need at least a 45 arcmin image to comfortably see the footprint.
Change the color, delete, or add more copies of the HST footprints from
the layers pop-up.<P>

<img src="img/jwstall.png"> <strong>JWST footprints.</strong>
You can overlay the whole focal plane footprint, shown here, or
individual instrument footprints (FGS, MIRI, NIRCAM, NIS, and NIRSPEC).
<P>
<strong>Note that</strong> if you overlay the footprint on a very
small image, nothing will appear to have happened. You need at least a
30 arcmin image to comfortably see the entire JWST focal plane. Please consult the <a
href="http://www.stsci.edu/jwst/">JWST documentation <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for details
about the footprints.  In all cases, if the footprint is 'active', a
circle near the middle of the footprint will appear with four small
circles ("handles") around it. Grab and drag the small circles to
rotate it, or drag the big circle to move it. Change the color,
delete, or add more copies of the footprints from the layers pop-up.<P>

<img src="img/wfirst.png"> <strong>WFIRST focal plane
footprint.</strong> As above, the footprint can be moved or rotated.
Click and drag the boresight (the cross hairs), which appears by
default to the upper right of the array of squares.  A circle appears,
centered on the boresight, with four small circles ("handles") around
it. Grab and drag the small circles to rotate it, or drag the big
circle to move it. <strong>Note that</strong> if you overlay the
footprint on a very small image, nothing will appear to have happened.
You need at least a 60 arcmin image to comfortably see the footprint,
and even then you will probably have to click and drag to see the
entire footprint. Consult the <a
href="https://wfirst.ipac.caltech.edu/">WFIRST documentation <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for
specifics on the apertures. Change the color, delete, or add more
copies of the WFIRST footprint from the layers pop-up.<P> 


<A NAME="breakingout"><h3>Breaking out of the pane (and going back)</h3></A>

The Catalog Search Tool results screen is broken up into panes - one
for images (top left), one for catalogs (bottom), and one for plots
from the catalog (top right). For some purposes, it is useful to
individually view just the table, or the images, or the plots, as
large as possible. In any pane, this icon <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">  appears in the upper right of the pane. 
Clicking on it will expand the pane into a larger window, as big as
possible given your browser size.<P>

Click on "close" in the upper left to return to the default "window
pane" view.<P>



<A NAME="autozoom"><h3>Automatic FITS-HiPS-Aitoff Transitions</h3></A>

When your catalog is loaded, it will load an image on your behalf.  You
will have this kind of display above the image it loads:<br> <img
src="img/aitoffhipsfits.png"><br> In this case, there was an all-sky
search that resulted in an Aitoff image being loaded. <P>

By default, it picks an appropriate image -- Aitoff for all-sky, HiPS
for a large-field view, and FITS for a small-field view. But, what if
you really want it to use a HiPS image and it's picked an Aitoff
image? Click on the buttons ("FITS", "HiPS", or "Aitoff") to change
the type of image that is used.  <P>

If you click the "Auto" checkbox (seen next to the FITS/HiPS/Aitoff
buttons), then it will, all by itself, make a choice between these
projections. Start with an Aitoff image? Zoom in several steps, and once
you are down to a 180 degree FoV, it will swap to a HiPS image. Zoom
in more, and once you get down to a much smaller FoV (the specific
value depends on the images used), it will swap to a FITS image. Zoom
out, and it will swap back to HiPS, as appropriate.<P>
