<h2>ZTF Image Service: User Registration for the IRSA Archives</h2>

There is one user registration for all IRSA applications, but data
access, preferences, search history, data tagging, etc., are all
unique to each archive.<P>

While you certainly <b>do not have to register</b> to search the
archive, download data, analyze data, and write a paper, you may wish
to register. <P>

On the other hand, <strong><em>if you have access to the ZTF
proprietary data, you will need to log in</em></strong> so that the
system grants you access to your data.  If you got email from the ZTF
project about account information, you may already have an account;
otherwise you can set up an account (see below).  Once you have set up
an account, please contact the ZTF project so that we can tie your
new account to your proprietary data.  <P>
