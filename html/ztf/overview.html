<h4>The ZTF Telescope and Camera</h4>

The <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">Zwicky
Transient Facility
(ZTF) <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> is a synoptic sky survey being carried out on the <A
HREF="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/sot.html"
target="_blank">48-inch Oschin Schmidt Telescope <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> at Palomar
Observatory, which is the same telescope as used for the well-known <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSS" target="_blank">POSS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
survey in the 1950s. <P>

Using a reworked version of the same telescope as <a
href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu" target="_blank">PTF and iPTF <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>,
ZTF uses a new camera, with an instantaneous field-of-view of 47
square degrees. This new camera will enable a full scan of the visible
sky every night, and will be a direct lead-in to the LSST era.<P>


<h4>For More Information</h4>

<p>
More information on the ZTF can be found at <A
HREF="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">the project home
page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. <P>




<H3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></H3>

<P> Since all data are proprietary, to get access to any data, you <a
href="user.html">must log in</A> to be able to view or download these data.<P>


The ZTF Image Service contains all image data available from ZTF,
subject to the requirement that it has been actually both processed
and deposited in the archive (these are separate operations). Image
data products are separated into three types:

<dL>
<DT>Science Exposure</DT>
    <DD> Single science (as opposed to calibration or reference)
    image. At this time, all data are proprietary.
If you have proprietary access to these data, you <a
href="user.html">must log in</A> to be able to download these data. </DD>
<DT>Reference (coadd) Image</DT>
    <DD> Image derived from combining the Science Exposure single
    frame data, such as
deep sky coadded data and the catalogs derived from such data. The
coadded mosaic is sometimes referred to as  the
"coadded image", or "reference image", or even "Level-2 Coadd". </DD>
<DT>Difference Image</DT>
    <DD> Image derived from a difference in Science Exposure single
    frame data. </DD>
</dL>


Catalog data products can be downloaded with the images, or separately
from the images, from this interface. The catalogs can be overlaid on
the images and interact with it using the tools found here.<P>


<H3><A NAME="searching">Searching</A></H3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="basics.html#searching">here</A>.  <P>

Searching <a href="basics.html#searching">by position</A> is the most
popular search, and you can also <a href="basics.html#byTable">search
in "batch mode"</A> by uploading a table.    <P>

In the search pane, from the options on the left, you can also search
by <a href="basics.html#byZTFField">ZTF Field ID</A>, or <a
href="basics.html#bySSO">Solar System Object/Orbit</A>.<P>



<H3><A NAME="results">Results</A></H3>

The search results appear in two "panes" (like "window panes"). You
can grab and drag the division between the two panes to change their
relative sizes. <P>

The left pane of the search results contains a table that includes one
line per observation, and one tab per data type you requested on the
search page. Each line includes basic information about all
the ZTF images which fulfill your search critera. The listed
FITS images can be downloaded by checking the box at the beginning of
each row (or the box at the top of the column of boxes to select all)
and clicking "Prepare download".  (See the section on <a
href="downloads.html">downloads</A> for more information.)<P>

The right pane of the search results contains three tabs that enable
exploration of the data returned by your search. Click on a row in the
left pane and the contents of the right pane change.  The "Image
Preview" enables an interaction with the real FITS Image corresponding
to that green row. See <a href="visualization.html">the section on
visualization</A> for more information.  The "Coverage" tab shows the
current image in context with the other images returned by your
search, overlaid on an IRAS image as a background image. You can also
manipulate that image; see <a href="visualization.html">the section on
visualization</A> for more information. The "Details" tab shows
selected details of the selected image.
<P>

Above the right pane, there are icons that look like this: <img
src="img/tablegridview.png">  You can choose to view your results in
either "Table View" or "Grid View". "Table View" lists the available
observations in table format in the results (left) pane and only
displays (on the right) the images associated with the currently
selected image set (highlighted in green in the results pane table).
Alternatively, "Grid View" simply displays all of the images of the
search results in the results (left) pane. Note also that, in the
"grid view", the "select all" checkbox appears not on the top of a
column, but in the upper right, under the expand icon: <img
src="img/selallgrid.png" align="top"> <P>

When in 'grid view', it may be helpful to change the right hand panel
to have the 'Details' (rather than the 'Image Preview') tab in the
foreground to allow you to quickly assess the properties of the
selected image.<P>


<strong>NOTE THAT north is not necessarily up in the images.</strong> <P>


<h4>Results: Columns</h4>

When you do a search for images, a table is returned with information
about the images (image metadata) meeting your search criteria that
allows you to decide which images you want to download.<P>


Columns that are returned for a science exposure  image search include the following:

<h4>Results: Filtering</h4>

Filters can provide a powerful tool for weeding down search results to
the observations you want. Near the top of the search results window,
there is this icon: <img src="img/filter.png"> Click on this icon in
order to start the process of adding filters. A text entry box appears
above each of the current catalog columns, with a small version of the
filter icon corresponding to that row on the far left. You can type
operators and values in these boxes -- hit return after typing or
click in another box to implement the filter. For fields with a
limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a filter icon
will appear; click on it to select from the available choices.  For
example, in the science exposure data, the column "filter code" corresponds to the
filter that was used. To limit your search results to just the one
filter, and find the "filtercode" column. Above that column, there is a
funnel icon. Click on that, and it will give you a choice of limiting
your results to one of the values that appear in your results. You can
select 1 or more than 1; the options change to reflect the actual data
you have listed. (If your search results contain only R band filters,
then you won't have an option to select g band filters.) Similar
filtering capability exists for any column in the results. <P>

Filters can be used in combination - on the science exposure 
results, for example, you could also add "seeing &lt; 2.0" to further
restrict results to only the best data.  Note that the filters are
logically "AND"ed together -- that is, if you impose logically
inconsistent restrictions such as "seeing &gt; 2.5" and "seeing &lt
1", no data will result, because no data are (can be) both less than 1
and greater than 2.5 at the same time.  <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which you are querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value you are specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the parameter
on which you are querying is included within the list you are
specifying (if the column filter is free-form text, type
"value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1 or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>

After you impose a filter, then the "filters" icon on the top right of
the catalog pane has changed to remind you that there has been a
filter applied, in this case just one filter: <img
src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on the
cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>


<h3><A NAME="visualization">Visualization</A></h3>

ZTF images  found by the search are displayed to the right of the
search result table.  If a single position search was used, this
position will be highlighted in a blue circle in the images shown
under "Image Preview" or "Coverage". There is an image toolbar, with
zoom and stretch features, among others, that appears near the top of
the browser window. <P>

The "Image Preview" tab shows the FITS image corresponding to the
selected row in the left pane; the "Coverage" tab shows the location
of each of the images which fulfill the search as an overlay on an
IRAS 100 micron image. Note that only the images shown on the current
search page are shown; the coverage corresponding to the currently
selected (highlighted) row is also highlighted in the coverage
visualization. If several images were taken at exactly the same
location, there may appear to be only one polygon shown on the image;
click on different rows on the left to highlight the polygon in the
image on the right corresponding to that image.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization section</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

You can also interact with a variety of catalogs through this
interface. See <a href="catalogs.html">the catalogs section</A> for
more information on interacting with catalogs and images.<P>



<h3><A NAME="download">Downloading Data</A></h3>

After deciding what data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox(es) on the left side, and click "Prepare Download" to begin
the packaging and data download process. (To 'select all', click on
the checkbox on the top of the column of checkboxes.) The download
then gets passed to a background job for packaging.  See <a
href="downloads.html">the section on downloads</A> for more
information.<P>

<h3><A NAME="preferences">User login</A></h3>

The ZTF Image Service can remember you when you return.  See the <a
href="user.html">user registration section</A> for more information. 
<P>


<h3><A NAME="help">Getting more help</A></h3>
The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help, as does "ZTF
Help" from under the "Help" in the IRSA menu on the top of the
ZTF page. You can also download a PDF version of this manual; look at
the top of the help window.
