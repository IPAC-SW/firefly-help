<H3><A NAME="overview">Overview</A></H3>

In the simplest case, on the search results page, just click the
checkboxes on the far left of each row to pick specific data files to
download, and then click "Prepare Download" to begin the packaging
(and downloading) process.  A pop-up window will appear in order to
define exactly what kinds of data you would like to have packaged up.
Clicking "prepare download" in the pop-up initializes this process.<P>

To select <em>all</em> of the data you have displayed, click on the
checkbox at the top of the column of checkboxes, and all of the rows
are automatically clicked (even those on subsequent pages if you have
more than one page).  Then click "Prepare Download" to initiate the
packaging process.<P>

The packaging process spins off into the <a
href="basics.html#background">background monitor</A>, which keeps
track of its progress and notifies you when the downloads are
complete. You can choose to have an email sent to you to let you know
when things are ready, even after the packaging process has started. 
<P> 

(If you want to save an individual image, stretch, and/or overlays, use
the <a href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">visualization
diskette icon</A>.)<P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. Look for a
"Downloads" folder or search for recently modified files. <P>


<H3><A NAME="downloadoptions">Options for Downloading Data</A></H3>

From the pop-up, you can choose what to download:<br>
<img src="img/downloadoptions.png"><br>
You can download the science image products, ancillary files (including
catalogs), cutouts or full images, and have the resultant files stored
all in one folder (flattened) or subdivided into subfolders (structured). <P>


The last section of the pop-up gives you an option to provide an email
address to which it will send an email when the packaging is done.
(Within the same session, or if you are logged in, it remembers what
you have entered before, but when initiating a new session, you will
have to re-enter this information.)<P>

Click "Prepare Download" in the pop-up window, and it will go do
it!<P>

When it packages up the data, it will spin off to the <a
href="basics.html#background">background monitor</A> and create zip
files. This process could be virtually instantaneous, or take some
time. You can watch it in the background monitor. If your packaging is
taking longer than expected, you can add an email address mid-stream,
and it will email you when it is done.<P>

<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: If you asked for difference images
to be returned as part of your search, then tried to download a
difference image without changing the default download options, you
will not get a difference image! If you want to download the
difference image, you will need to explicitly select the difference
image in the download options.<P>


<H3><A NAME="downloadScript">Downloading Script</A> </h3>

The Download Retrieval Script dialog gives you some options regarding
which script you want to use. Generally speaking, the wget script is
best for Linux and Unix users. The curl script is best for Mac users,
because curl is part of the standard OS distribution; Mac users can
also go retrieve and install <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/" target="_blank">wget <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and then use the
wget scripts. For any of the scripts, you can also choose to include
an option that unzips the zip files automatically.  The files stay on
disk here for at least 72 hours, so you have a window of time to
download them.<P>

Save the script to a plain text file, and invoke the script.  You can
copy and paste the script lines individually into your terminal
window, or by  typing "csh [yourtextfile]" at the prompt.  The files
will be automatically and sequentially downloaded to your disk, and if
you've selected that option, unzipped as well.  <P>

For Windows users, download and save the text file of URLs . Then follow the
following steps to install the wget script and then download your data:
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm" target="_blank">Windows wget web page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>
<li>Scroll to the Download section and retrieve the wget installation.
<li>Install wget and add the binary to your path.
<li>Download the text file of URLs 
<li>At the command prompt: wget --content-disposition -i &lt;file_of_urls_downloaded.txt&gt;
</ol><P>


Depending on how, exactly, you unzip your files, your computer may put
the contents of each <em>zipfile</em> into one directory, rather than,
say, the contents of each <em>observation</em> into one directory. If
you are using a GUI-based method (e.g., click to uncompress), there
should be a preferences option to allow you to uncompress subsequent
zipfiles into the same root directory.  If you use the download script
above, the flags sent on the command line that unzip the files should
put all files from the same observation in the same directory.<P>

<H3><A NAME="contents">Contents of your download - Quick Start</A> </h3>

We
strongly recommend reading the documentation at the <a
href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">ZTF site <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> to
understand the contents of your download. However, very briefly, 
depending on what level you are downloading, and what files you select
for packaging when you download your data, you can get:
<UL>
<LI> Science exposures:
	<UL>
        <LI>log.txt</LI>
        <LI>mskimg.fits</LI>
        <LI>sciimg.fits</LI>
        <LI>sciimlog.txt</LI>
        <LI>sexcat.fits</LI>
</LI>
<LI>Calibration frames:

        <LI>*bias.fits</LI>
        <LI>*hifreqflat.fits</LI>
