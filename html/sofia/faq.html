<h2>SOFIA Science Data Archive: FAQs</h2>

<DL>


<dt>Do you have any tutorial videos?  <dd>Yes. The <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> has several tutorials that
are relevant to the SOFIA Science Data Archive -- see the SOFIA
playlist as well as the set of "micro-tutorials" relevant for more
than one archive. The videos are in HD; you may need to manually use
the YouTube gear menu to force it to realize this. There is also
English Closed-Captioning available.<P>

<DT>I have a bunch of targets and I want to get all the images for
these targets. Can I do this?
<dd>You can give it a <a href="basics.html#byTable">list of
sources</A>, up to 1000 sources, and it will go away and think about
it and load them all into the browser. You can customize the stretch,
color table, etc. You can then ask it to <a
href="downloads.html">prepare the download</A> for you, and when it's
done, if you want, mail you a list of URLs to download the data.<P>


<dt>I've created a nice image within the FITS viewer, and I have the
stretch and overlays exactly the way that I want them. How do I save
this?
<dd>Click on the diskette icon and tell it to save the PNG file. If
you just save the FITS file, you will lose the overlays, and if you
just save the overlays (as a ds9 region file), you will lose the
underlying image.<P>

<dt>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard.<P>

<dt>How do I get more help?
<dd>
The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. You can also
download a PDF version of this manual; look at the top right of the
help window.<P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk" target="_blank">IRSA
Help Desk</A>.<P>

<a name="bugs"></A><strong>Found a bug?</strong> The known bugs and
issues in this version of the SOFIA Science Data Archive are listed <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/sofiabugslist.html"
target="_blank">here</A>.  If you think you have found a bug, before
reporting it, please check this list, and read this online 
help. It may be a "feature" we already know about.  If you have found
a new, real bug then please do contact us via the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk</A>. Please include your operating
system version and your browser software and version.  If you can,
please also include any specific error message you may have gotten.
(NB: In our testing, copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux;
the command-C did not work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the
right mouse button did.)<P>
