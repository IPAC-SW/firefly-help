<h2>SOFIA Science Data Archive: Overview</h2>

The SOFIA Science Data Archive at IRSA is ultimately the repository
for all data collected by SOFIA. The third release has data from most
instruments (EXES, FIFI-LS, FLITECAM, FORCAST, FPI+, GREAT, HAWC+),
Cycles 1 through Cycle 8 (ongoing); proprietary data has access
restrictions. (More information below.)<P>

Note that there are also SOFIA Science Data Archive video tutorials,
available at the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>. Look for the playlist collecting all the SOFIA
videos in one place.<P>

<H3><A NAME="history">Background</A></H3>

SOFIA is an 80/20 partnership of NASA and the German Aerospace Center
(DLR), consisting of an extensively modified Boeing 747SP aircraft
carrying a 2.7-meter (106 inch) reflecting telescope (with an
effective diameter of 2.5 meters or 100 inches). The aircraft is based
at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California. The
SOFIA Program Office is at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field,
California, which manages SOFIA's science and mission operations in
cooperation with the Universities Space Research Association (USRA;
Columbia, Maryland.) and the German SOFIA Institute (DSI; University of
Stuttgart).<P>

<LI><strong>Mission ID</strong> is a unique mission identifier. In the
SOFIA framework, a mission is the same as a SOFIA flight. (<a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync?format=html&query=select+distinct+jsonb_extract_path_text%28telescope_keywords%2C%27MISSN-ID%27%2C%270%27%29+as+mission_id+from+sofia.observation+order+by+mission_id"
target="_blank">List of all the SOFIA Mission IDs in the SOFIA Science
Data Archive <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, retrieved
via <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/TAP.html">TAP
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.) <P>

<LI><strong>Flight Series</strong> means a grouping of missions (flights)
close in time where SOFIA originates from the same airfield and the
same instrument is used.<P>

<LI><strong>Plan ID</strong> is the identifier for the observing plan
which contains all the observations (AORs). Each accepted observing
program has a Plan ID; this can be thought of as basically a proposal
ID. (<a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/TAP/sync?format=html&query=select+distinct+proposal_id+from+sofia.observation+order+by+proposal_id" target="_blank">List
of all the SOFIA Plan IDs in the SOFIA Science Data Archive <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>,retrieved via <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/program_interface/TAP.html">TAP <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.)<P>

<LI><strong>AOR</strong> is astronomical observation request, an
individual SOFIA observation sequence. Each AOR involves many
frames, and therefore multiple files. <P>

<LI><strong>AOR ID</strong> is the AOR identifier.  The AOR ID is
assigned during the creation of the final version of an AOR to be used
in flight. Multiple observations in one or more flights and/or
instrument configurations can be associated with a single AOR.<P> 

<LI><strong>Observation ID</strong> is the combination of Mission ID
and AOR ID, which together uniquely identifies each SOFIA observation. An
observation will contain multiple data files. AOR ID by itself is not
sufficient since some AORs are spread across multiple flights. <P>

</UL>

In practice, during a SOFIA mission (or flight), several Plan IDs (or
programs) are executed, and each of these consist of one or more
AORs.<P>

The Mission ID, Plan ID, and AOR ID are metadata that can be found in
the header of an AOR file.<P>


<a name="datalevels"><strong>Data levels</strong></A>
<UL>
<LI><strong> Level 0:</strong> raw data in FITS format. 
<LI><strong> Level 1:</strong> raw data in FITS format.
<LI><strong> Level 2:</strong> data corrected for instrument
artifacts (e.g., flat-fielded, dark-subtracted, bad pixels
removed).
<LI><strong> Level 3:</strong> flux calibrated and telluric
corrected data (e.g., units of Jy/pix).
<LI><strong> Level 4:</strong> Any data product generated from the
combination of Level 3 files (e.g., a mosaic) is a Level 4 product.
For most instruments, Level 4 products could be generated from
observations obtained across multiple flights, or even multiple flight
series and observing cycles.
</UL>
Note that not all instruments will have all data levels.

<strong>Specific items, caveats, etc. to keep in mind</strong><P>
<DL>
<DT>General information
<DD><UL>
<LI>In an all-sky search, some columns in the result table have
missing PLAN ID (i.e., PLAN ID= unknown). These are typically
calibration observations. <P>

<LI>In an all-sky search, many rows of the result table have the
Proposal PI column blank. These are typically calibration observations
but may also be data products combining many different observations. 
<P> 

<LI>Some observation dates are erroneously set to 1970.<P>

<LI>Data that are not public have release dates that are the actual,
future release dates. Data that are aleady public may have the most
recent processing date, as opposed to the date that the original
observations actually went public.<P>

<LI>Some AOR ID and Plan ID are erroneously set to obviously incorrect
values.<P>

<LI>Some positions, especially in the earliest data, have larger
uncertainties. Recommend larger search radii to be sure you're
catching all the relevant observations.<P>

<LI>The Preview tab in the results is only populated for (some) GREAT
and HAWC+ Level 4 products, and other instruments (or low level data
for any instrument) will have blank "No Preview Available." This is
working as intended.<P>

<LI>When NAIF ID appears to conflict with Target Name, believe the
NAIF ID. This is most common for some of the calibration AORs.<P>

<LI>Some data from the current observing cycle may only be available
at Level 1 if the data are still being processed.<P>

<LI>If the Observation Type is not OBJECT, do not not necessarily 
believe the Target or NAIF ID fields; it could be, e.g., flatfields at
a completely different position (not the stated target).<P>

<LI>On searching for occultation observations: there are two choices.
Easier: use the precovery search. Search for the occulter of interest,
and look for results with target_moving = 0, which is equivalent to no
NAIF_ID. Harder: do an all-sky query and filter the results by the
object name of the occulter you're interested in (example: Titan).
Results for that object but with no NAIF_ID are likely occultations,
since the telescope was pointing at a sidereal target. You can confirm
by looking at the proposal abstract in the AOR tab (example:
06_0160).  <P>

<LI>The GUI filtering menu for Product Type considers blank fields to
be "NULL" (for example, FLITECAM raw data), which seems a bit
misleading but is working correctly (this is a feature not a bug).<P>
</UL>



<DT>EXES
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>EXES started operations in 2015, so no data are available before
that date.<P>
<LI>Level 1 raw files have no Product Type; Level 2 files have Product
Type "raw".<P>
<LI>The EXES instrument does not have Level 4 data products, so an
all-sky query for EXES Level 4 returns no results. <P>
<LI>Peculiar values for spectral resolution indicate calibration files.<P>


</UL>

<DT>FIFI-LS
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>FIFI-LS started operations in 2014, so no data are available before
that date.<P>
<LI>Peculiar values for spectral resolution are shown here as
propagated from the FITS headers.<P>
<LI>Level 4 wxy_resampled, HDU 10, display shows pixels in units of Jy
even though it's a coverage map.<P>

</UL>


<DT>FLITECAM
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>FLITECAM was retired in 2018, so no data exist after that date for
this instrument.<P>
<LI>The blank spectral resolution for FLT_A1_LM (energy bounds 4.4-5.53
microns) is working as intended; the Observer's Handbook doesn't list R 
for that combination of grism and order sorting filter.<P>
<LI>The FLITECAM instrument does not have Level 4 data products, so an
all-sky query for FLITECAM Level 4 returns no results. <P>
<LI>OC1E FLITECAM data is only Level 1, so there is no Level 2/3.<P>
<LI>Some data products may be included in the download that according
to the Data Handbook should not have been saved or archived.<P>
</UL>

<DT>FORCAST
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>The FORCAST instrument only rarely has Level 4 data products, so an
all-sky query for FORCAST Level 4 returns relatively few results. <P>

<LI>The cross-dispersed modes, X-, were not used in Cycle 4 and Cycle
5, so an all-sky query for FORCAST, GRISM, FOR_XG063 or FOR_XG111,
returns 0 results.<P>

<LI>The FORCAST definition of SW and LW cameras is fluid so a few
short wavelengths (such as 6.4 micron and 11.2 micron) fall under the
LW category. This should not surprise the user. A complete definition
of SW and LW cameras is provided on Table 7-3 at
<a
href="https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/proposing-and-observing/sofia-observers-handbook-cycle-5/7-instruments-iv-forcast/71-1">https://www.sofia.usra.edu/science/proposing-and-observing/sofia-observers-handbook-cycle-5/7-instruments-iv-forcast/71-1 <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A><P>

<LI>Users should be aware that in the FORCAST query menu, the second
number that appears on the Spectral Element menu is the filter width
(in microns) of a given filter. This is not the same as the spectral
resolution, which is the quantity provided in the FORCAST result tab
under "Details". Most spectra are resolution (R)~100; cross-dispersed 
spectra (XG*) are R~1000. Medium and narrow-band imaging filters can
also have a resolution (R~45-70). <P>

<LI> FORCAST footprints in the coverage tab may be larger than
expected.  NAXIS* and CDELT* are the same for different levels, yet
Level 1 is shown with a much smaller footprint than Levels 2-3. The
valid data really is a 256x256 square, but the Level 2 coadd has an
actual fits header with NAXIS*=656, with the valid data embedded
within a square of NaNs. The coverage software sees the 656 pixel
dimensions in the  actual FITS headers and draws the larger square.<P>

<LI>FORCAST FOR_F086 energy_bounds and spectral resolution may not be
populated.<P>

</UL>


<DT>FPI+
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>FPI+ started operations in 2015, so data is only available after
that date.<P>

<LI>The FPI+ Instrument Team has not generated an instrument
handbook, so this is not currently available.<P>
</UL>


<DT>GREAT
<DD>
<UL>

<LI>The GREAT instrument does not have Level 2 data products, so an
all-sky search for GREAT Level 2 returns 0 results.<P>

<LI>Not all the GREAT data are in FITS format. All the Level 1 data
are FITS files, while Level 3 data are tarfiles consisting of CLASS
files, and Level 4 can be either CLASS or FITS. (Level 2 data do not
exist for this instrument.)<P>

<LI>GREAT Level 4: velocities derived by Firefly are wrong.<P>

<LI>GREAT previews may not exist for all data.<P>

<LI>For the GREAT instrument, a frequency channel is defined as a delta
function, not as a Gaussian with a FWHM. This has to be kept in mind
when performing a query by frequency. This is not the case for the
other instruments.<P>

<LI>Some early GREAT observations have low spectral resolution (~1e3
instead of the usual ~1e7) from a rarely-used continuum mode.<P>

<LI>Some GREAT Line values seem unusual, like an observation of
Jupiter with Line="L2_saturn", but those refer to continuum settings
originally used on one calibrator but that may sometimes be used on
others.<P>

<LI>GREAT files with INSTMODE=CAL have incorrect coordinates, target
name, and NAIF ID. Unfortunately the INSTMODE keyword isn't visible to
users without downloading the files <P>

<LI>The GREAT Instrument Team has not generated an instrument
handbook, so this is not currently available.<P>
</UL>


<DT>HAWC+
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>HAWC+ started operations in 2016, so HAWC+ data is only available
after that date.<P>
<LI>The raw data from HAWC+ correspond to Level 0 rather than Level 1.
(Level 1 is raw for all the other instruments.)<P>
<LI>A few early HAWC+ observations used both band A and B in the same
Observation, which results in the band B energy_bounds not being
computed correctly since the ingest code sees a band A Observation and
doesn't expect or allow for spectral elements to change within an
Observation. <P>

<H3><A NAME="searching">Searching (Quick Start)</A></H3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail in the <a href="searching.html">Searching section</A>.  <P>

Searching <a href="searching.html#byPosition">by position</A> is the
most popular search, and you can also <a
href="searching.html#byTable">search in "batch mode"</A> by uploading
a table, from your local disk or the <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">IRSA Workspace</A> (which is a bit of disk space for
you at IRSA).<P> 

You can also search for Solar System objects by NAIF ID.<P>
<!-- , or search
over the whole archive.    <P> -->

You can add additional constraints to, e.g., show only observations
from one program or one flight or one instrument. Go to the <a
href="searching.html">Searching section</A> for much more detailed
information. <P>



<H3><A NAME="results">Results Overview</A></H3>

The search results appear in two "panes" (like "window panes"). You
can grab and drag the division between the two panes to change their
relative sizes. <P>

The left pane of the search results contains lists of observations
that met your criteria. The right pane of the search results contains
more details of the observations. The right pane changes depending on
what row you have selected (clicked on) in the left pane. (And the
left pane can change depending on what you have selected in the
coverage image in the right pane.)<P>

Proprietary data (to which you do not have access in general) are red
rows; public data are white rows. <P>

The basic table manipulation tools are documented in the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>.<P>

For more information, see <a href="results.html">the Results
section</A>.<P>



<h3><a name="visualization">Visualization Overview</A></h3>

The images meeting your search criteria are shown as the results of
the search, in the instrument tabs. The small circle overlaid by
default is the search position you submitted.  <P> 

Move your mouse over any image that is returned by your search.
Details about the image and, specifically, the pixel beneath your
mouse cursor, appear along the top of the window with a variety of
useful items (see screenshot below). Some information is updated in
real time (such as coordinates); some information (such as flux
densities) is updated when you stop moving your mouse for a second or
two.  The image can be interactively investigated in this fashion.
<br> <img src="img/readout.png"> <P>

There is a toolbar across the top of the window from which you can
interact with the displayed FITS image files -- you can control the
stretch, add a coordinate grid, etc. Clicking on the icon that looks
like this: <img src="img/expandimagetiles.png"> enlarges the
images to take up more space in the browser, and you can further zoom
to make a single image take as much space in the browser as possible.
You can scroll through all of the images in this maximally "zoomed-in"
view. You can also add or remove overlays (such as coordinates or
distances) to your images. See <a href="visualization.html">the
Visualization section</A> for more on visualization.<P>

work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the right mouse button
did.)<P>
