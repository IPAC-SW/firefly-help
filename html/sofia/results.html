<h2>SOFIA Science Data Archive: Search Results</h2>

Results of a <a href="searching.html">search</A> of the SOFIA Science
Data Archive appear in two different window panes, each with several
tabs.<P>

<H3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></H3>

The search results appear in two "panes" (like "window panes"). You
can grab and drag the division between the two panes to change their
relative sizes. <P>

<H3><A NAME="layout">Layout</A></H3>

The left pane of the search results contains lists of observations
that met your criteria. The right pane of the search results contains
more details of the observations. The right pane changes depending on
what row you have selected (clicked on) in the left pane.<P>

The <strong>left pane</strong> of the search results could have
several tabs -- one called "AOR" that is a list of AORs, and then one
for each instrument you have selected ("instrument tabs"). The columns
are different in each tab.  Each line includes basic information about
all the observations which fulfill your search critera.  Each tab is
its own table, which behaves in the same way that tables throughout
IRSA tools with this look and feel. See the <A
href="tables.html">Tables</A> section for more details, but in summary
you can change the width of the columns, sort by columns, filter by
column values, etc.<P>

The corresponding data can be downloaded by checking the box at the
start of each row (or the box at the top of the column of boxes to
select all) and clicking "Prepare download".  (See the section on <a
href="downloads.html">downloads</A> for more information.)<P>

The <strong>right pane</strong>  of the search results contains three
tabs that enable exploration of the data returned by your search.
Click on a row in the left pane and the contents of the right pane
change.  The "Details" tab provides details about the observation. The
"Data" tab does not show anything when the AOR tab is in the
foreground. The "Coverage" tab shows footprints of all the returned
observations on an image; you can interact with the image using the <a
href="visualization.html">visualization tools</A>. <P>

In the coverage tab, you will see an indication of what portions of
the sky are covered by the data meeting your search criteria. Click on
the 'layers' icon to bring up a window with the list and to change
colors or symbols (see <a href="visualization.html">visualization
tools</A>). If you have done an all-sky query, the symbols used are:
<UL>
<LI>EXES - red square marker
<LI>FIFI-LS - burgundy square marker
<LI>FLITECAM - green square marker
<LI>FORCAST - pink square marker
<LI>FPI+ - small purple dot
<LI>GREAT - magenta cross marker
<LI>HAWC+ - small cyan dot
</UL>
If you have done a search that is not all-sky, you have a smaller
region of sky shown in your coverage tab. For portions of the sky
comparable to 30 arcmin or larger, you likely have a HiPS image;
smaller regions may be shown on a FITS image. (see <a
href="visualization.html">visualization tools</A>).
<P>

When an instrument tab is in the foreground on the left pane, the
"Details" and "Data" tabs change accordingly. The "Data" tab has (for
non-proprietary and non-GREAT data) the FITS file corresponding to the
observation. You can interact with this FITS file using the <a
href="visualization.html">visualization tools</A>; you can also
overlay <a href="catalogs.html">catalogs</A> on the image. Note that
GREAT data may not be in FITS format, and thus you cannot interact
with the data, other than simply downloading it. The "Coverage" tab
still indicates an indication of what portions of the sky are covered
by the data meeting your search criteria. Note that even if an
instrument tab is selected, the coverage tab shows all the results
retrieved by the search. The coverage tab and the instrument tab are
linked in that if you click on a row in the instrument tab, the
corresponding symbol in the coverage tab is highlighted, and vice
versa.  <P>

If you do a <a href="searching.html#byTable">multiple target
search</A>, so that you can more easily tie results to input, when you
get results back from a batch search, the input RA and Dec are columns
appended to the end of your results tables.<P>


<H3><A NAME="filtering">Filtering Results</A></H3>

Filters can provide a powerful tool for weeding down search results to
the observations you want. Near the top of the search results window,
there is this icon: <img src="img/filter.png"> Click on this icon in
order to start the process of adding filters. A text entry box appears
above each of the current catalog columns, with a small version of the
filter icon corresponding to that row on the far left. You can type
operators and values in these boxes -- hit return after typing or
click in another box to implement the filter.  After you impose a
filter, then the "filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane
has changed to remind you that there has been a filter applied, in
this case just one filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png"> To clear
the filters, click on the cancel filters icon (which also appears
after you impose filters): <img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>


There is <a href="tables.html#filters">a whole section just on
filtering<A>, which has much more information.<P>



<h3><a name="visualization">Visualization</A></h3>

Once you have data that you wish to investigate further, you can
interact with the FITS files corresponding to most observations. 
See <a href="visualization.html">the
Visualization section</A> for more on visualization.<P>
