<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the IRSA/PTF Image
Service </h2>

<dl>
<dt>I've retrieved a catalog from the catalog tab (e.g., not a PTF
catalog). What are all these columns?
<dd>
The columns that are returned are exactly those that are stored in the
corresponding archive for that catalog. Each catalog is different.
Please check the project's documentation for each catalog separately
-- catalogs retrieved from IRSA have documentation that is available
at IRSA, but you can also retrieve catalogs via the VO, so the
documentation for those catalogs would be at the catalog's place of
origin. Some of the more commonly used IRSA ones are:

<dt>I've created a nice image within the FITS viewer, and I have the
stretch and overlays exactly the way that I want them. How do I save
this?
<dd>The diskette icon in the toolbox enables you to save the image as
a FITS file (no overlays), a ds9 region file (just the overlays), or a
PNG file (a copy of what you are viewing, image with that stretch plus
overlays).<P>&nbsp;<P>

<dt>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard.<P>&nbsp;<P>

<dt>How do I get more help?
<dd>
The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help, as does
"PTF Help" from under the "Help" in the IRSA menu on the
top of the PTF page. You can also download a PDF version of
this manual; look at the top of the help window.<P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk" target="_blank">IRSA
Help Desk</A>.<P>&nbsp;<P>

<dt><a name="bugs">How do I report a bug?</A>
<dd> The known bugs and
issues in this version of the PTF Image Service are listed <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/ptfbugslist.html"
target="_blank">here</A>.  If you think you have found a bug, before
reporting it, please check this list, and read this online PTF Image
Service help. It may be a "feature" we already know about.  If you
have found a new, real bug then please do contact us via the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk</A>. Please include your operating
system version and your browser software and version.  If you can,
please also include any specific error message you may have gotten.
(NB: In our testing, copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux;
the command-C did not work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the
right mouse button did.)<P>&nbsp;<P>
