<H3><A NAME="history">History and Background</A></H3>

<h4>The PTF Telescope and Camera</h4>

The <a href="http://ptf.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Palomar Transient Factory
(PTF)</A> was a synoptic sky survey that was carried out on the <A
HREF="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/sot.html"
target="_blank">48-inch Oschin Schmidt Telescope</A> at Palomar
Observatory, which is the same telescope as used for the well-known <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSS" target="_blank">POSS</A>
survey in the 1950s. <P>

The PTF camera was formerly the CFHT-12k camera and has been
substantially modified for its new mission, most notably through the
use of a mechanical cryo-cooler instead of liquid nitrogen, a new
image flattener, and electronics modifications. The camera has 11
functional 2048x4096 CCDs, with a roughly 1 arcsecond per pixel plate
scale, yielding a total area per exposure of just over 7 square
degrees. A shutter provides accurate exposure timing. A filter
exchanger mechanism allows up to two filters to be used. Typically,
these are R and g-band; an additional set of H-alpha filters are also
in use.<P>

The camera saw first light at Palomar on December 13, 2008 and was in
routine operations from mid-2009 to 2017. Since 2017, the survey has been
operating as <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf"
target="_blank">ZTF</A>.<P>

<h4>PTF Survey Design, Achieved Performance, and Processing</h4>

<p> Unlike many previous sky surveys, PTF did not use a raster scan
of the sky. A typical night consists of several complex interlocking
programs, with different cadences. The most typical is the 5-day
cadence: two exposures are taken roughly one hour apart, and then
repeated again five days later. This program was primarily aimed at
transient science such as SNe. Other cadences were much higher with
daily repeats, and target nearby galaxies. Such programs are also
aimed at stellar science. Finally, certain regions of the sky (such as
Orion) are subject to extremely high cadence observations and are
observed essentially continuously. 

<p> Under ideal conditions, the spatial resolution was roughly 2
arcseconds; under typical site conditions, this varied from 2 to 3
arcseconds. Exposure times for regular survey data were 1 minute. Under
dark conditions, this produced a typical limiting g-band magnitude of
21.5 (AB) and R-band of 20.6 (AB).

<p> Data flow immediately to LBL and IPAC through the San Diego
Super-Computing Center. LBL provided real-time image subtraction and
detection, and was the discovery engine for transients in the data.
IPAC performed high-fidelity reduction and calibration of the data, and
maintains a repository for all image data as well as 
catalog access. <!-- Typical turnaround times for IPAC processing are of
order 2-3 days before they appear in this archive.-->

<H3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></H3>

The PTF Image Service contains all image data available from PTF,
subject to the requirement that it has been actually both processed
and deposited in the archive (these are separate operations). Image
data products are separated into three basic types:

<dL>
<DT>Level 0</DT>
    <DD> Raw data. This is received from the observatory as a
multi-extension FITS file containing all 12 CCDs. At this time, no
Level 0 data are publicly available; all Level 0 data are proprietary.
If you have proprietary access to these data, you <a
href="user.html">must log in</A> to be able to download these data. </DD>
<DT>Level 1</DT>
    <DD> Processed data corresponding to the original single CCD
exposures. These individual image files are sometimes simply referred
to as "single exposure", "processed images", or even sometimes
"frameproc." Level-1 data can consist of calibrated FITS images, mask
images, and calibrated photometric catalogs in binary FITS table
format.  </DD>
<DT>Level 2</DT>
    <DD> Products derived from combining the Level 1 data, such as
deep sky coadded data and the catalogs derived from such data. The
coadded mosaic is sometimes referred to as the "Level-2 Coadd", or
"coadded image", or even "reference image". Level-1 data can consist of 
calibrated FITS images and calibrated photometric catalogs in binary FITS table
format.</DD>
</dL>

<P> If you have proprietary access to any particular data you know are
there, you <a href="user.html">must log in</A> to be able to download
these data.<P>

Catalog data products currently can be downloaded with the images, not
separately from within this interface. If you want to overlay the
catalog on the images and interact with it using the tools found here,
download the data (including the catalog), convert the catalog to IPAC
table format, go to the catalogs tab, and upload the catalog from your
own disk.


<H3><A NAME="searching">Searching</A></H3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="basics.html#searching">here</A>.  <P>

Searching <a href="basics.html#searching">by position</A> is the most
popular search, and you can also <a href="basics.html#byTable">search
in "batch mode"</A> by uploading a table.    <P>

In the search pane, from the options on the left, you can also search
by <a href="basics.html#byPTFField">PTF Field ID</A>, or <a
href="basics.html#bySSO">Solar System Object/Orbit</A>.<P>



<H3><A NAME="results">Results</A></H3>

The search results appear in two "panes" (like "window panes"). You
can grab and drag the division between the two panes to change their
relative sizes. <P>

The left pane of the search results contains a table that includes one
line per observation. Each line includes basic information about all
the PTF images which fulfill your initial search critera. The listed
FITS images can be downloaded by checking the box at the beginning of
each row (or the box at the top of the column of boxes to select all)
and clicking "Prepare download".  (See the section on <a
href="downloads.html">downloads</A> for more information.)<P>

The right pane of the search results contains three tabs that enable
exploration of the data returned by your search. Click on a row in the
left pane and the contents of the right pane change.  The "Image
Preview" enables an interaction with the real FITS Image corresponding
to that green row. See <a href="visualization.html">the section on
visualization</A> for more information.  The 'Coverage' tab shows the
current image in context with the other images returned by your
search, overlaid on an IRAS image as a background image. You can also
manipulate that image; see <a href="visualization.html">the section on
visualization</A> for more information. The 'Details' tab shows the
details of the selected image. <P>

Above the right pane, there are icons that look like this: <img
src="img/tablegridview.png">  You can choose to view your results in
either "Table View" or "Grid View". "Table View" lists the available
observations in table format in the results  pane and only  displays
the images associated with the currently selected image set
(highlighted in green in the results pane  table). Alternatively,
"Grid View" simply displays all of the images of the search results.
Note also that, in the "grid view", the "select all" checkbox appears
not on the top of a column, but in the upper right, under the expand
icon: <img src="img/selallgrid.png" align="top"> <P>

When in 'grid view', it may be helpful to change the right hand panel
to have the 'Details' (rather than the 'Image Preview') tab in the
foreground to allow you to quickly assess the properties of the
selected image.<P>


<strong>NOTE THAT the Level 2 Coadded (reference) images are oriented
North-up, and the Level 1 images (individual exposures) are
North-down.</strong> <P>


<h4>Results: Columns</h4>

When you do a search for images, a table is returned with information
about the images (image metadata) meeting your search criteria that
allows you to decide which images you want to download.<P>

<h4>Results: Filtering</h4>

Filters can provide a powerful tool for weeding down search results to
the observations you want. Near the top of the search results window,
there is this icon: <img src="img/filter.png"> Click on this icon in
order to start the process of adding filters. A text entry box appears
above each of the current catalog columns, with a small version of the
filter icon corresponding to that row on the far left. You can type
operators and values in these boxes -- hit return after typing or
click in another box to implement the filter. For fields with a
limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a filter icon
will appear; click on it to select from the available choices.  For
example, in the Level 1 data, the column "filter" corresponds to the
filter that was used. To limit your search results to just the one
filter, and find the "fid" column. Above that column, there is a
funnel icon. Click on that, and it will give you a choice of limiting
your results to one of the values that appear in your results. You can
select 1 or more than 1; the options change to reflect the actual data
you have listed. (If your search results contain only R band filters,
then you won't have an option to select g band filters.) Similer
filtering capability exists for any column in the results. <P>

Filters can be used in combination - on the Level 1 results, for
example, you could also add "seeing &lt; 2.0" to further restrict
results to only the best data.  Note that the filters are logically
"AND"ed together -- that is, if you impose logically inconsistent
restrictions such as "seeing &gt; 2.5" and "seeing &lt 1", no data
will result, because no data are (can be) both less than 1 and greater
than 2.5 at the same time.  <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which you are querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value you are specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the parameter
on which you are querying is included within the list you are
specifying (if the column filter is free-form text, type
"value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1 or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>

After you impose a filter, then the "filters" icon on the top right of
the catalog pane has changed to remind you that there has been a
filter applied, in this case just one filter: <img
src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on the
cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>


<h3><A NAME="visualization">Visualization</A></h3>

PTF images  found by the search are displayed to the right of the
search result table.  If a single position search was used, this
position will be highlighted in a blue circle in the images shown
under "Image Preview" or "Coverage". There is an image toolbar, with
zoom and stretch features, among others, that appears near the top of
the browser window. <P>

The "Image Preview" tab shows the FITS image corresponding to the
selected row in the left pane; the "Coverage" tab shows the location
of each of the images which fulfill the search as an overlay on an
IRAS 100 micron image. Note that only the images shown on the current
search page are shown; the coverage corresponding to the currently
selected (highlighted) row is also highlighted in the coverage
visualization. If several images were taken at exactly the same
location, there may appear to be only one polygon shown on the image;
click on different rows on the left to highlight the polygon in the
image on the right corresponding to that image.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization section</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

You can also interact with a variety of catalogs through this
interface. See <a href="catalogs.html">the catalogs section</A> for
more information on interacting with catalogs and images.<P>



<h3><A NAME="download">Downloading Data</A></h3>

After deciding what data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox(es) on the left side, and click "Prepare Download" to begin
the packaging and data download process. (To 'select all', click on
the checkbox on the top of the column of checkboxes.) The download
then gets passed to a background job for packaging.  See <a
href="downloads.html">the section on downloads</A> for more
information.<P>

<h3><A NAME="preferences">User login</A></h3>

The PTF Image Service can remember you when you return.  See the <a
