(Note that catalogs are available via a blue tab that appears at the
top of the page only after you have performed at least one search --
you need to have something on which to overlay the catalog before it
will let you search.)<P> 

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs for
overlaying on your <a href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>.

<A NAME="overview"><H3>Catalogs -- Overview</H3></A>

Once you have conducted a search and have some displayed images, you
can perform a catalog search, which will (among other things) overplot
those catalog sources on all the images shown.  Catalogs are available
via a blue tab that appears at the top of the page only after you have
performed at least one search -- in essence, you need to have
something on which to overlay the catalog before it will let you
search.<P> 

By default, it assumes you want to perform a catalog search that
covers the same region as your recent WISE search, and pre-fills the
form with that region -- but you can choose to change those search
criteria. You can choose from any of a number of catalogs, including
but not limited to WISE catalogs. You can also upload your own
catalogs. <P>

The catalog will be overlaid on the images in the coverage pane as
well as all of the WISE channels shown in the image display pane. The
highlighted source will change depending on which source is selected
in the catalog tab in the results pane. When overlaying the sources
from a catalog search, note that <em>all</em> the sources are shown.
<P>



<h3><a name="irsacatalogs">Catalogs from IRSA</A></h3>

By clicking on the "Catalog" tab (which also looks like a button), a
window appears with several options, as follows.<P>

By default, the catalog search page appears with a polygon search
approximating your prior search.  You can customize the search for
options beyond a polygon search (e.g., a cone search) by selecting
from the "Search Method" pulldown. The entry box immediately to the
right of that "Search Method" pulldown changes accordingly, and you
can edit the parameters directly. If you choose a 'cone' search, you
can also change the target by clicking on "Modify Target" next to the
target center that appears. <strong>Caution</strong>: pick your units
from the pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a
number and then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number
from the old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower
limits to your search radius; it will tell you if you request
something too big or too small. Note that these limits are
catalog-dependent.  <P>

You then need to specify the catalog you want to search. In order to
help it give you a specific list of choices, you need to first tell it
the project (default: 2MASS) and category (default: 2MASS All-Sky
Release Database) and then, on the right, you can pick the  catalog
(default: 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog). To change catalogs,
first select the "project" under which they are housed at IRSA, such
as 2MASS, IRAS, WISE, MSX, etc.  The options under the "category" and
the specific clickable catalog on the right change according to the
project you have selected.  A short description is provided for each
of the catalogs, with links for more information (including
definitions of the sometimes cryptic column names); an example is
here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>


You can also set restrictions on specific columns by clicking on  "Set
Column Restrictions" on the left hand side, under the "category"
selection pull-down menu. A new window will open up with the
available column names in the corresponding catalog, and you can
choose what to display, and filter what is returned (for example, only
return objects with values in column y that are greater than x). If
you add more than one restriction, they are combined logically using
an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus restrict data
such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.<P>

<em>Power user tip:</em> By default, this interface may show you fewer
columns than are available in the full catalog. By clicking on "Set
Column Restrictions" and selecting "long form" from the pulldown at
the top of the pop-up window ("Please select long or short form
display"), you can access the full range of available columns. In some
cases, there are literally hundreds of columns that you can access!<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. It will load the catalog
into a tab of its own. The catalog objects will also be overlaid on
the images you have loaded. You can obtain a full-screen view of your
catalog -- click on the expand icon in the upper right of the window
pane when your mouse is in the window: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">.  You can also make an x-y plot from the
catalog (for more on the x-y plots, see <a href="#xyplots">below</A>).
The images and the catalog representations are interlinked -- clicking
on a row in the table shows it on the images and vice versa.<P>

To close the catalog search window without searching on a catalog,
click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>


<dl><dt><strong>On the speed of the catalog results...</strong><P>

<dd>If the catalog search is successful quickly, it will promptly return
the results in a tab of its own. <P> 

<b>NOTE THAT</b> the search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened, but be patient and eventually it will either spin off to
the background monitor (from which you can load it into a tab), or
return a tab directly.<P>

Searches that take longer than a few seconds get spun off to the <a
href="basics.html#background">background monitor</A>. If it does spin
off to the background monitor, it will dynamically update to reflect
its status, and will let you know when the catalog is ready to
download or display. A popup appears asking if you want to load the
catalog. Either click on the popup or explicitly open the background
monitor and click on the catalog name to load it into a tab of its
own.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer. Searches that retrieve millions of rows will take
quite a while. <P>

</dl>

Note that if you overlay a catalog consisting of tens of thousands of
sources, to save bandwidth, what is overlaid on your image at some
locations may be a larger symbol representative of several sources at
that location; if you then <a
href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">save a regions file from
the catalog overlay</A>, then you will end up with fewer sources in
the regions file than you have in the full catalog.<P>


<h3><a name="owncatalogs">Loading your own catalogs</A></h3><P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the top left of the catalogs screen, "Load
Catalog", to load your own catalog.<P>

Your catalog needs to be in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format</A>, which is a varietal of plain
text. IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table reformatting and validation service</A> which
may be helpful, or you can download just about any catalog you find
through IRSA, and copy that format.<P>

Your table file MUST have RA and Dec values, and unless it is
specified, it assumes J2000. <P>

You can add a "SYMBOL" parameter to change the shape
(X, SQUARE, CROSS, EMP_CROSS, DIAMOND, DOT) of catalog marks, e.g.:
<pre>
\SYMBOL = X
</pre>
<P>

You can add a "DEFAULT_COLOR" parameter to assign a CSS color name or
a HEX value to catalog marks, e.g., either of these two:
<pre>
\DEFAULT_COLOR = lightcyan
\DEFAULT_COLOR = #00FF00
</pre>
You can find the <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color code or the CSS color HEX values</A> online.<P> 

(You can obtain a full-screen view of your catalog; click on the
expand icon in the upper right of the window pane when your mouse is
in the window: <img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. You can also <a
href="#xyplots">plot your catalog</A> -- see below for more details.)


<h3><A name="vocatalogs">Catalogs from the VO</A> -- Overlaying
catalogs obtained via the VO</h3>

(VO= <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Virtual
Observatory</A>.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the top left, "VO Catalog", to search for
and load  catalogs from the VO.<P>

<br><img src="img/vocatalogs.png" width="100%"><br>
<P>

As for the IRSA catalog search, the tool pre-fills the target position with
the coordinates of the target with which you have been working. In
this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next option is the
cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the pulldown first,
and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from
the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to the
new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. <P>

If you know your VO URL already, you can jump down to the Cone Search
URL box and type or paste your URL into the box and hit search.<P>

More commonly, however, users do not know <em>a priori</em> which URL
to use. Type your desired keywords into the keywords box and click on
"Search Registry". All of the URLs it finds for your keywords within
the VO registry service are shown in the box. Locate the one you want
to use, and click on "Use" on the far left of the corresponding row.
The "Cone Search URL" is populated properly for that catalog. Click on
"Search" to initiate the search. <P>

The search results are then shown (and interacted with) in the same way as
the other catalogs described here.<P>

<strong>Example</strong><p>

Load the tool. Search on IC1396. Go to the catalogs tab. Choose "VO
Catalog." It wants the root URL for a cone search. I click on "Find
Astronomical Data Resources", which takes me <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/" target="_blank">here</A>.
Search on IPHAS. Get <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/keyword-search/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=iphas"
target="_blank">this page</A>. Look for the complete catalog release
(not just one associated with one specific study). The name of the
catalog goes <a
href="http://vao.stsci.edu/directory/getRecord.aspx?id=ivo://CDS.VizieR/II/321"
target="_blank">here</A>. Hit the [+] to expand it. There is one URL
listed there, under "available endpoints for the standard interface."
Copy that URL and paste it into the search form. The IRSA tool will
append your coordinates and radius and return you a table.<P>



<strong>Troubleshooting</strong><p>

Note that searching the VO means that you are using resources not
specifically housed at IRSA, so servers may be down, or timeouts set,
or limits on numbers of returned sources, etc., that are beyond our
control. In most cases the solution is to specify as precise a search as
possible.  Here are the links to VO registries that we are using, just
in case you want to do more flexible searches of the registry. The URL
you enter into the box in FinderChart, though, must be a Cone Search
base URL (not containing RA and Dec parameters, which are inserted
into the URL by FinderChart in response to the search parameters you
give it).<P>

The master list of registries is <a href="http://rofr.ivoa.net/"
target="_blank">here</A>. You can also search the registries directly
via that link (as opposed to via the IRSA tools). <P>

<!-- The registries we are searching are, in this order:
<UL>
<LI>Euro VO: <a href="http://registry.euro-vo.org/search.jsp"
target="_blank">http://registry.euro-vo.org/search.jsp</A>

<LI>NVO: <a href=" http://nvo.stsci.edu/vor10"
target="_blank">http://nvo.stsci.edu/vor10</A>

<LI>Astrogrid: <a href="http://registry.astrogrid.org"
target="_blank">http://registry.astrogrid.org</A>
</UL>

Euro VO supports ADQL, which makes it possible to search just the
title and identifier. Other registries provide only the keyword
search, which is much less precise, since it looks for matches in all
the fields, including the description.<P>  -->




<a name="filter"><a name="filters"><A name="filtering"><h3>Columns and filters 
with catalogs</h3> </A></A></A>

After you have loaded a catalog, it appears as an additional tab in
the right-hand-side search results pane. Additional catalogs you load appear as
additional tabs in this window pane. To see more of the columns (and
see more of the options described shortly below), grab the divider
between the two window panes and slide it right to widen the 
pane until you can see the icon that looks like this: <img
src="img/tableoptions.png">.<P>

The table is shown exactly as it appears in the database, with all
columns as defined for that catalog. To understand what each column
is, please see the documentation associated with that catalog
(available via the catalog searching popup window, see figure below,
or by navigating through the IRSA website.)<br> <img
src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

The tab (and table) name itself is the name of the catalog file as
stored on the system at IRSA; it is a little cryptic, but the first
few words should make it clear whether it is WISE, 2MASS, etc. To
remove the tab, click on the blue "X".<P>

Immediately below the tab name, there are several symbols:<br> <img
src="img/tablehead.png"><br> which we now describe.<P>

The first thing to notice is that only the first 50 rows of the
retrieved catalog are displayed in the table. In the example, there
are 647 sources that were retrieved as part of the search.  The black
arrows plus the page number allow you to navigate among these 'pages'
of 50 sources each.  Note that the entire set of results (not just the
50 rows you are currently viewing) can be sorted alphabetically by
clicking on any column's name. (Note also that in the plotting and
overlay features described below, all the sources in the catalog are
plotted on the images you have, not just the 50 shown in the first
page.)<P>

Going from left to right along the top of the catalog tab, the next
icon represents a filter: <img src="img/filter.png"> Filters are a
<em>very</em> powerful way of exploring the catalog data.  Click on
this icon in order to start the process of adding filters. A text
entry box appears above each of the current catalog columns, with a
small version of the filter icon corresponding to that row on the far
left. You can type operators and values in these boxes -- hit return
after typing or click in another box to implement the filter. For
fields with a limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a
filter icon will appear; click on it to select from the available
choices. As an example, to show only those sources with declination
above a certain value (say, 31 degrees), type "&gt; 31" in the box
above the "dec" column. Or, if you have retrieved a WISE catalog and
would like to only view the objects with a W1 (3.4 micron)
profile-fitted magnitude less than 6 magnitudes, above the 'w1mpro'
column, type "&lt; 6" in the form.  <P>

After you impose a filter, then the number of rows in the catalog is
restricted according to the rules you have specified, and the
"filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane has changed to
remind you that there has been a filter applied, in this case just one
filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on
the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>

Note that the filters are logically "AND"ed together -- it will impose
this AND that AND this other restriction. You can relatively easily
restrict things such that no data are left; if that is the case, you
will get "There are no data to display." You can then cancel all the
filters at once via the cancel filters icon (<img
src="img/cancelfilters.png">), or remove them individually by hand by
editing the filter boxes at the top of each column, just as you did to
impose the filters. <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which you are querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value you are specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the
parameter  on which you are querying (such as "Bandpass") is included
within the list you are specifying (if the column filter is free-form
text, type "value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1
or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>

The next icon is <img src="img/texttable.png"> -- clicking on this
changes the table display into a text display. The icon then changes
to <img src="img/table.png"> -- click this again to return to the
default table view.<P>

The next icon is <img src="img/savetable.png"> which is "Save" -- this
is how you may save the whole catalog (<em>NOTE: the WHOLE TABLE, not
just the rows shown</em>) to your own local disk. It will save it as
an <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table file</A>, which is basically ASCII text
with headers explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by
vertical bars.  By default, the file is called "GatorQuery.tbl"
because, under the hood, the software is talking to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/"
target="_blank">IRSA General Catalog Query Engine</A>, powered by
Gator.<P>

The next to last option on the top of the catalog tab is this: <img
src="img/tableoptions.png">.  Clicking on this icon brings up options
for the table, e.g., how many rows are displayed per page, and which
columns are shown. By default, all columns are shown. The default page
size is 50 rows.  Note that expanding the page size to numbers much
greater than 50 may result in a substantial performance degradation
(e.g., your browser will appear to freeze or not appear to be doing
anything while it manages and renders the large table).  <P>

Note also that if you resize columns, and then go and add new columns,
the original columns are resized back to their defaults after the new
columns are added.<P>

Finally, when your mouse is in the catalog window pane, you see this
as the last option on the top of the catalog tab: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">. Clicking on this expands the catalog
window pane to take up the entire browser window. To return to the
prior view, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>

You can also interactively impose filters from <a
href="#xyplots">plots you make</A> from the catalog - see the next
section.<P>


<h3><a name="xyplots">Plotting catalogs</A></h3>

You can plot your catalog after it has loaded. The plots are another
view of the catalog; by default, the catalog comes up in 'table' view,
and you can swap back and forth between the 'table' and 'plot' view.
After you have loaded a catalog, these icons appear in the upper
right, just above the image results pane: <img
src="img/viewoptions.png"> The first one is table view, and the second
is plot view. The current view is boxed in green. Click on the icon to
change views. If you do not see this icon, make sure that a catalog
tab is in the foreground of the target list pane.  To see more of the
catalog while still viewing images, click and drag the slider between
the panes to enlarge the plot window pane. <P>

To obtain a full-screen view of your plot, click on the expand icon in
the upper right of the window pane when your mouse is in the window:
<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. To return to the prior view, click
the "Close" arrow in the upper left.<P>

The plotting tool, by default, starts with RA and Dec plotted. Note
that it does so strictly mathematically correctly -- that is, RA
increases to the right (the reverse of astronomical convention). To
change what is plotted, click on the gears icon in the upper left of
the plot window: <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png">. Configuration
options then appear to the left of the plot. You can choose a single
column to plot against another column -- if you have loaded a WISE
catalog, you could plot w1snr vs. w1mpro. You can start typing a
column name into the X and Y boxes, and it will help provide you
viable options from the column headings. Alternatively, you can click
on the "Cols" link to bring up a pop-up window with all the columns
for that catalog listed. NOTE THAT you must type in the column name
<em>exactly matching</em> the column headings as displayed.  By
default, it echoes the x and y labels and units from the original
table, but you can change this by clicking on the triangles below each
entry box (e.g., make the label "SNR in WISE-1" rather than the more
cryptic column header "w1snr"). <P>

You can also do simple mathematical manipulations. For example, if you
have loaded a WISE catalog, you can plot w1mpro vs. w1mpro-w4mpro.
However, note that as of this version, the axes are from min to max in
the strict mathematical definition of the term, so in this example,
the fainter W1 objects are at the top of the plot. As a workaround for
this, plot -w1mpro vs. w1mpro-w4mpro to get the axes aligned in the
way you are expecting such that brighter objects are at the top of the
plot. <br>

<img src="img/plotscreenshot.png" width="100%"><P>

Note that the plot symbols are shades of grey corresponding to how
many points are represented at that location in the plot. The lightest
shade of grey (and smallest points) represent one point in the plot
at that location, and the darkest shades of grey (and the largest
points) represent many more points in the plot at that location. Put
your mouse over any of the points to find out more about what is
represented at that location.<P>

You can add or remove the gridlines via the "Grid" checkbox. If you
have zoomed in enough such that there are just black boxes -- one
object per point -- you can change the plot style such that the points
are connected or unconnected. <P>

You can also <strong>restrict what data are plotted</strong> in any of
several different ways. You can set limits based on the "more options"
(click on the triangle next to "more options") on the lower left of
the plotting window pane, or you can use a rubber band zoom, as
follows.  Click and drag in a sub-region of the plot. The icons in the
upper right of the plot change corresponding to what you can do, in
this case to these: <img src="img/plotoptions.png">. They are, from
left to right: zoom in on the region you have selected, select the
objects in the catalog, filter the catalog to leave only those
objects, or expand the plot to take up the whole browser screen. If
you click on the zoom icon, then the plot axes change to encompass
just the sources you have selected. If you click on the select icon,
then the plot symbols corresponding to your selection change shape and
color, the corresponding objects overplotted on the image in the image
window pane change color, and (if you change back to the table view of
the catalog), the rows (corresponding to those sources) in the catalog
are highlighted. If you click on the filter icon, then the catalog
view is filtered down, restricted to just those sources you have
selected, and the filter notes in the upper left of the plot window
(and in the table view of the catalog) change to remind you that you
have a filter applied. Only those sources that pass the filter are
shown overlaid on the image(s). (This is the behavior of 'filter', as
opposed to 'select'; the former restricts what is shown, the latter
just highlights the objects.) For more on filters, see <a
href="#filters">the filter section</A>.<P>

Another option within the "More Options" in the lower portions of the
plot settings has to do with the display aspect ratio. You can make a
plot more square or more rectangular by changing the x/y ratio here
(set it to 1 for a square plot), or you can tell it "fit": make it fit
in the available space, or "fill": make it as big as possible in the
window.<P>

If you move your mouse over any of the points, you will get a pop-up
telling you the values corresponding to the point under your cursor.
If you click on any of the points, the object(s) corresponding to that
point will be highlighted in the overlays in the images shown, and
highlighted in the catalog table view of the catalog.  This works the
other way too - click on a row in the catalog, or an object in the
images, and the object will be highlighted in the plot or the catalog
or the image.<P>

<strong>If you have a very large catalog or many points in a
particular location of the plot</strong>, the tool will rebin the
points in the plot such that displaying the plot is faster. The plot
symbols are shades of grey corresponding to how many points are
represented at that location in the plot. Put your mouse over any of
the points to find out more about what is represented at that
location. It will tell you how many catalog rows correspond to that
point, and clicking on it will highlight all of the corresponding rows
in the table view and the image overlays. In order to have the tool
plot one point per row, you need to zoom in or otherwise restrict the
data such that there are 'few enough' points represented in the plot.
If there is just one point in the plot that needs to be rebinned, all
of the points will be a small point. <P>

<strong>Want to save a plot to file?</strong> At this time, the best
way to do that is a screen snapshot. On a Mac, this is accomplished
via holding down command, then shift, then 4, then let go and your
mouse cursor changes. Hit the space bar to select the window over
which your mouse is hovering. Your mouse cursor changes again, and hit
the mouse button. A snapshot is then saved to your Desktop, tagged
with the date and time. <P>

Once you have made an x-y plot, the plot is then effectively treated
as another 'image' in the stack of images you have loaded into the
tool. In the <a href="visualization.html#breakingout">Visualization
section</A>, it describes various features, including blinking images,
and removing images from the blink sequence. If, after you make a
plot, you want to blink or tile some of the FITS images, you will need
to remove the plot from the image sequence, as described in the <a
href="visualization.html#breakingout">Visualization section</A>.


<h3><a name="examples">Examples of catalog plots</A></h3>

<strong>Example: Plotting [W1] vs. [W1]-[W4] in a star-forming
region</strong><P>

In a star-forming region defined for this example, we are trying to
find young stars. We will search in the WISE AllWISE catalog. Stars
without circumstellar dust should be at a variety of W1 brightnesses,
but all have [W1]-[W4]~0.  Background galaxies should be faint and
red. Stars with circumstellar dust (e.g., young stars) should be
bright and red. Here, we will make a plot, identify a bright and red
object in the plot, and find where it is in the WISE images.

<OL>
<LI>Launch the WISE Image Service. Search on IC1396. Simbad's
interpretation of the coordinates are fine. Set "return image size" to
be 1 degree, being sure to pick the units before entering a number. 
Set "Return only the most centered image" to "no." Select the ALLWISE
release.
<LI>When it comes back, click on the blue "catalogs" tab near the top
of the search results. Leave the search method and vertices as what it
comes set up with as the default - it is set to cover a region similar
to your original search. Select Project=WISE. Select Category=AllWISE
Database. Select the AllWISE Source Catalog (as opposed to the
single-exposure or Solar System catalogs, or...). 
<LI>You may have to wait a bit for the ~20,000 rows in the catalog to
be returned. It will ask you if you want to load the results into
their own tab. Say yes.
<LI>Note that all ~20,000 sources are overplotted on the images to the
left and below the catalog. Note that selecting a source in the image
makes its corresponding row in the catalog turn green; selecting a row
in the catalog makes its corresponding source in the overplotting turn
blue. (Your search target is a blue circle, the selected source in the
image is a default blue square with an x in it.)
<LI>Click on the plot icon in the upper right: <img

It will take a few seconds to plot all ~20,000 sources.
<LI>It comes up with an RA/Dec plot by default, and depending on the
size of your monitor, it may be very small. Click on the expand <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png"> icon in the upper right of the plot
window. Click on the one-image-at-a-time icon in the expanded view if
necessary, and navigate to find the plot.
<LI> Two things to note about the plot: (1) RA is increasing to the
right, not the left, because it is plotting strictly mathematically
min-to-max. (2) Each point represents more than one row of the
catalog. Mouse over or click on a point to see how many rows are
represented: <img src="img/morethanonepoint.png">
<LI>Click on the gear <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"> icon in the
upper left of the plot window.
<LI>Enter in the x box: w1mpro-w4mpro. This is WISE-1 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes minus WISE-4 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes,or [W1]-[W4].
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "X label/unit", and enter
"[W1]-[W4]" for the label. Enter "mag" for the unit.
<LI>Enter in the y box: -w1mpro  (the minus sign is important to put
the bright objects at the top of the plot, but note that the numbers
as plotted will then be negative.)
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "Y label/unit", and enter [W1] for
the label. Enter "mag" for the unit.
<LI>Leave the "grid" box checked.
<LI>Click "Apply."
<LI>Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex1-plot.png" width="100%"><br>
<LI>Note that all of the points are shades of grey, denoting that
at least one of the points in the plot is representative of more than
one row in the catalog.
<LI>Click and drag from corner given roughly by (2,-6) to (7,-12). 
<LI>The icons in the upper right change after you do this, and we want
to zoom on this region. Click on the magnifying glass with a "+"
inside.
<LI>After we zoom, there are far fewer shades of grey in the points.  
This means that there are far fewer points in the same location in the
plots. Zoom enough, and every point will turn into a small, black
square, which denotes that every point shown is truly a single row in
the catalog.
<LI>Find the brightest source near [W1]-[W4]~5. Click on that point. 
<LI>Click on "Close" in the upper left to return to the window pane
view.
<LI>The bright, red object we selected in the plot is highlighted in
the overlays on top of the images and in the catalog table view. To
find it easily, you can do one of two things: <OL><LI> Click on the
expand image icon in one of the loaded WISE images. Click on one of
the resize icons until the highlighted source is visible. Zoom in some
more and click and drag the image to center it, if desired. Note that
you may have to select another point in the plot and then go back to
this bright red point in this example to get it to re-draw the
highlighted point on the image.  <LI> OR... Click and drag around this
point in the plot view of the catalog. Click on the blue filter icon
in the upper right. The plot at this point looks silly, but only that
point is left in the overlay of sources on the images and in the
catalog table view. (If you have been following closely, it should be
J213817.32+573121.9.)  As for the prior option, you may need to move
around in the WISE image until you can find it.</OL>
<LI>Click on the table view icon  to return to the table view.
Depending on which option you chose in the prior step, if you filtered
the catalog, then you have one and only one row left in the table
(J213817.32+573121.9). If you didn't filter, the row corresponding to
this source is highlighted green in the table.

<strong>Example: Plotting [W1] vs. time </strong><P>

The WISE orbit takes it past the ecliptic poles every orbit. Much of
the rest of the sky was observed more than once as well. In order to
see how brightnesses are changing in time for any source within the
WISE mission, you have to look at the single exposure data products,
rather than the summed-up Atlas images. Here, we will plot how a
source in IC 1396 changed with time within the WISE mission.<P>

NOTE THAT, as described in the Explanatory Supplement, depending on
the single exposure source table used, you may or may not get all of
the epochs obtained by WISE. Please see the Explanatory Supplement for
details.<P>

<OL>
<LI> Search on IC1396. Simbad's interpretation of
the coordinates are fine.  Set an image size of 30 arcminutes. Set
"Return only the most centered image" to "no."  Select "All-sky
(4-band)" since the AllWISE release does not include individual
exposures. Uncheck "Atlas" and check "Single Exposure." Search. 
<LI>Click on the blue "catalogs" tab near the top of the search
results. Select Project=WISE. Select the AllWISE database. Select the
"AllWISE Multiepoch Photometry Table". Change the search method to
'cone' and limit the radius to 1.5 arcmin. Search. Perhaps get a coffee
if you don't have to go too far.
<LI>It will come back in a little while with a catalog containing the
measurements of objects on each frame. NOTE: if you are not careful
about setting the search radius carefully, you will need to walk down
the street to get a coffee, and the catalog will come back with many,
many thousands of rows. Several functions are disabled when
interacting with tables that large. If you have more than that, either
do a catalog search again on a smaller area, or filter down your
catalog to be a more resonable size.
<LI>Be patient, and it will also overlay the sources on the images. 
<LI>Identify a source to follow by one of the following:
<OL><LI>Click on the heading "ra" to sort the list by RA. Again, be
patient for the browser to update. Identify a source in the list that
seems to be the same source over many epochs, and make a note of its
RA and Dec.
<LI>Click on one of the brighter sources in the WISE images at the
bottom and note which row is highlighted, specifically its RA and Dec.
</OL>
<LI>Filter down the table to be just the source you care about. I
picked the source at 324.7408, 57.4888. At the top of the catalog
window, click on the filters icon. Boxes appear on the top of each
column. In the top of the RA column, enter: &gt;324.7406 &amp;
&lt;324.7409. Click in the top of the Dec column, and enter: 
&gt;57.48 &amp; &lt;57.489. For me, this leaves 52 rows corresponding
to measurements of this source. 
<LI>Switch to the plot view via the upper right: <img
src="img/viewoptions.png"> By default, it comes up with RA/Dec, which
looks somewhat silly for the single object we have selected.
<LI>Click on the expand arrows <img src="img/expand-24x24.png"> to
make the plot big.  Click on the gear <img
src="img/xyplotoptions.png"> icon in the upper left of the plot
window.
<LI>Enter in the x box: mjd.
<LI>Enter in the y box: -w1mpro_ep  (the minus sign is important to
put the brighter measurements at the top of the plot, but note that
the numbers as plotted will then be negative.)
<LI>Leave the "grid" box checked.
<LI>Click "Apply."
<LI>Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex2-plot.png" width="100%"><br>
<LI>Evidently, this source was visited in two different windows and
varied between 4.2 and 5  mags in W1 during the WISE mission. Click
and drag to select just the first window. Zoom in on the first window
of observations. Turn on "connect the points" to guide the eye. Click
"Apply." Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex2-plot2.png" width="100%"><br>
Further analysis (including the errors) will be required to determine
if this is significant variation.
