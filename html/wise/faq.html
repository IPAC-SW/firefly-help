<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the IRSA/WISE Image
Service </h3>

<h3>Interface questions</h2>

<dl>
<dt><i>What does WISE Level 3 and Level 1b refer to?</i>
<dd> 
WISE is the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. WISE mapped the sky
at four bands, 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns. This web application
accesses the IRSA/WISE Image Service, the repository of image data
from the WISE mission. Individual exposure (Level 1b) WISE images are
assembled into Atlas (Level 3) tiles 1.564 degrees on a side. The WISE
image server does not re-mosaic these tiles. The degree of overlap
between tiles is a function of declination. You can obtain all Atlas
tiles on which your object appears, or individual exposures. Atlas
tiles have point source profiles whose full width at half max (FWHM)
is sqrt(2) times larger than the native (single-exposure) values. (See
Explanatory Supplement for more details.)  The vast majority of the
sky will have coadded atlas images assembled from eight or more Level
1b frames.  Also note that WISE images are in DN, not in absolute flux
units.<P> <P> 

<dt><i>What is the difference between the different WISE Data Releases?</i>
<dd>
Please consult the extensive corresponding Explanatory Supplement for
the data set you choose to use. A grid with a brief description of the
data releases and links to the Explanatory Supplements is available at
the beginning of the <a href="overview.html">Overview chapter</A>.
<P>

<dt><i>I notice you are continuing to release new W1 and W2 data. Will
there be more W3 and W4 data?</i>
<dd>
No, sorry, not until there is a new spacecraft. WISE could only
observe at W3 and W4 when there was cryogen on board. When the cryogen
ran out, passive cooling allows us to continue observations at W1 and
W2.
<P>

<dt><i>I study inertial (not moving) targets. I notice that the newest
release of new W1 and W2 data only has photometry done on the
individual exposures. Will you be releasing a new version of the
AllWISE data, which summed up all the available data?</i>
<dd>
Funding does not permit summing up the images at this time. The
purpose of the NEOWISE and NEOWISE Reactivation missions is to look
for moving objects, which in fact require that the images NOT be
summed up. Until funding can be found to rerun the entire pipeline
that creates Atlas images and corresponding photometry, such a
resource is not available. There are tools to allow you
to sum up the images yourself, however. See the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html">WISE Mission
Page <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for the WISE Co-Adder.
<P>



<dt><em>In my search, I've selected AllWISE (multi-band), All-Sky (4
band), 3-Band Cryo, and Post-Cryo (2 band) images, but I am only
getting one set of 3 images (not even all four WISE bands). Why?</em>
<dd>Do you have "Return only the most centered image containing the
target" set to "yes"? If that is the case, you really will only get
the most centered image out of all of the image sets returned, not the
most centered image <em>per release</em>. Set that to "no" and redo
your search -- you should then find many more image sets.<P>

<dt><em>How can I tell which image set is which?</em>
<dd> If you selected multiple image sets and set "Return only the most
centered image containing the target" to no in your initial search,
you will most likely get multiple results from multiple releases.
There are two ways to distinguish them quickly.  The "image_set"
column (all the way on the right) is 2 for 2-band, 3 for 3-band, 4 for
4-band (cryo), 5 for AllWISE, and 6 for NEOWISE Reactivation (2-band).
The coadd_id also has this information - the first 8 characters is the
tile position, and the 4 characters after the underscore refers to the
processing iteration. *_ab31 is 3-channel, *_ab41 is 4-channel, *_ac51
is AllWISE. You can also look at the FITS header in one of the images
using the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization tools</A> -
nearly all the data were taken in 2010 but AllWISE was processed in
2013, so the file creation date should be in 2013 for AllWISE.<P>

<dt><em>But, wait, I selected multiple image sets but not all of them
have atlas tiles or single exposures..?</em>
<dd> Yes, the AllWISE image set contains only Atlas tiles, not
indvidual exposures. Similarly, the 2-band post-cryo image set
contains only individual exposures, no Atlas tiles.<P>

<dt><i>What's the file format that I need to use for the Multi-Objects search?</i>
<dd>Your multi-object search table must be in IPAC table format.
Examples and more details are provided <a
href="searching.html#byPosition">here</A>.<P>

<dt><i>How come the columns are different when I access the catalogs via
the IRSA <a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/"
target="_blank">catalog search <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and the catalogs tab here in the image service?</i>
<dd>While the image service is talking to the catalog search "under
the hood", yes, different columns are shown. There are a very large
number of columns available in the catalog search, and it can quickly
become overwhelming for new users to have all of those columns
available in the GUI interface. (Ex: for AllWISE, there are 334
columns in the main source catalog!) To get access to those additional
columns in the GUI interface, after you click on the catalogs tab, 
click on "Set Column Restrictions" on the left hand side, under the
"category" selection pull-down menu. A new window will open up with
the "short form" column names displayed by default. Change that to the
"long form" column names, and you will see <em>all</em> the available 
column names in the corresponding catalog. Click on the check box to
select what to display. You can also filter what is returned (for
example, only return objects with values in column y that are greater
than x). If you add more than one restriction, they are combined
logically using an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus
restrict data such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.  <P>


<dt><i>Do you have any tutorial videos?</i>
<dd>Yes. The <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w" target="_blank">IRSA
YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> has several tutorials that are relevant to WISE
-- see the WISE playlist as well as the set of "micro-tutorials"
relevant for more than one archive. <P>

<h3>File questions</h3>

<dl>
<dt><i>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?</i>
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, you should just be
able to doubleclick on it, and your computer should know what to do.
Or, from the command line, you can type "unzip foo.zip". To uncompress
multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'" (the single quotes are
important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have to escape out the
wildcard.<P>
