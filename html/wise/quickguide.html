<h2>IRSA/WISE Image Service Quick Start Guide:  
<font color="red">Getting Up and Running Fast</font></h2>

Detailed information about the acquisition, processing, and
calibration of WISE data can be found in the documentation that goes
with each release; see the table at the beginning of the <a
href="overview.html">Overview chapter</A>. Most people probably want
the <strong>AllWISE release</strong>. <P>

<b>Searching:</b><P>

Many search methods are available. Most people will probably want to
search by position, which is the default option. Target names can be
automatically resolved into coordinates using NED or Simbad, or you
can specify coordinates. See the section on <a
href="searching.html">searching</A> for more information.<P>

<b>Hints, Tips, and Term Definitions:</b> 
<UL>

<LI><b>"Most centered image"</b>:  WISE images are
assembled into Atlas tiles 1.564 degrees on a side. The WISE image
server does not re-mosaic these tiles. Using the "Return only the most
centered image containing the target" option, you can ask for either
just the Atlas tile most centered on your object, or all the tiles in
which your search object appears. Keep in mind that if you pick
multiple releases or sets, if "most centered image" is set to yes, you
really will only get the most centered image, not the most centered
image per release.<P>

<LI><b>Atlas and Single Exposure</b>:  Multiple WISE exposures are
assembled into Atlas tiles. If you want the highest level data
product, where all available exposures are added, select "Atlas". If
you want the individual exposures (which are higher spatial resolution
by a factor of about sqrt(2), but each are lower signal-to-noise),
select "Single Exposure."<P>

<LI><b>Source Catalog Queries:</b> In addition to searching for WISE
images, various WISE multiband source lists corresponding to each
delivery are also available for queries, via the Catalogs tab on the
top toolbar (which appears only after any search is performed). A
variety of other catalogs are also available. Catalogs can be overlaid
on images, filtered, and/or simple plots can be made.  Please consult
the page on <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs</a> for more
information.  Catalog queries may also be performed using the separate
<a href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/"
target="_blank">IRSA General Catalog Query Engine <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>; very
sophisticated (e.g., sql) or automated queries are more easily
obtained via that interface.  <P>

<li><b>Preliminary Data:</b> The Preliminary All-Sky and Preliminary
Post-Cryo Data Release Products are hidden by default because they
have been superceded by more recent releases. However, these may be
still accessed in lieu of the recommended product versions by
selecting the <i>Obselete preliminary release data</i> triangle for
additional options in the search pages. <p>

<LI><b>Search Results:</b> Depending on which data products you have
selected, the search results appear in up to 2 tabs: Atlas (Level 3),
and/or Single Exposure (Level 1b). Each tab provides a list of the
different levels of data retrieved by your search. See the page on <a
href="results.html">understanding your search results</A> for more
information. <a href="catalogs.html">Catalog searches</A> appear in
additional tabs in this window pane.<P>

<LI><b>Filtering:</b> Filters, either imposed on your initial search
or via <a href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can
provide a powerful tool for narrowing down the search results to the
observations you want. Filters also work on catalogs. <P>

<LI><b>Visualizing:</b>  <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization</A> provides powerful tools
for understanding how your object of interest was observed by WISE and
deciding which data to download. You can also visualize catalogs via
plotting.<P>

<LI><b>Downloading Data:</b> You can select specific datasets by
clicking on their respective checkboxes on the left hand side of their
listing; you can also select the entire set by clicking on the
checkbox on the top of that column. Then, click "Prepare Download" to
begin packaging your data for download in the background. See the
section on the <a href="basics.html#download">Background Monitor</A>
for more information.<P>
