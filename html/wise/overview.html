<h3>The Spacecraft and Instruments</h3>

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was launched on a Delta
II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base into a Sun-synchronous polar
orbit on  December 14, 2009. Consisting of a 0.4-meter telescope 
cooled to cryogenic temperatures by solid hydrogen, and a camera 
designed for simultaneous imaging at four infrared bands, WISE mapped
the sky in the mid-infrared at sensitivities over 100 times that of
the previous all-sky surveys. The 1024 by 1024 pixel HgCdTe and Si:As
detectors on WISE obtained critically sampled images at  wavelengths
of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns (also referred to as W1, W2, W3, and
W4, respectively) with spatial resolution ranging from 6 arcseconds
at the shortest wavelength to 12 arcseconds at the longest. The two
shortest wavelength bands are optimized for the detection of low
temperature brown dwarfs and stellar photospheres. The two longer 
wavelength bands sample the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution
of  warm dust around star-forming galaxies, asteroids, and stars with 
circumstellar material. More information on WISE can be found at <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html"
target="_blank">https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

WISE performs an all-sky survey uniformly with a single observing
strategy, namely scan mapping approximately along meridians of
constant ecliptic longitude. In scan mapping, the telescope slews
continuously across the sky while image motion compensation is
performed by an internal cryogenic scan mirror.  Images covering  a
region of 47 arcmin on a side were obtained simultaneously in all four
bands by using dichroics. Consecutive images overlap by about 10% in
the scan direction. At the ecliptic plane, WISE fields of view are
typically observed about ten times, with 90% overlap in the cross-scan
direction between consecutive visits. The number of overlapping
images, or "coverage", varies widely in the WISE survey, from just a
few frames in regions heavily impacted  by the moon in the ecliptic
plane, to many hundreds near the ecliptic pole. More information on
WISE can be found in <a
href="http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/140/6/1868/"
target="_blank">Wright et al. (2010) AJ, 140, 1868 <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>. <P>

WISE performed a four-band survey of 100% of the sky while it still
had cryogen on board, Dec. 14, 2009-Aug. 6, 2010. As the cryogen
started to be depleted, it surveyed 30% of the sky with 3 bands (Aug.
6, 2010- Sep. 29, 2010). When the cryogen was completely depleted, it
surveyed 70% of the sky with the remaining 2 bands (Sep 29, 2010-Feb
1, 2011). It was put into hibernation on Feb 1, 2011. It was
reactivated on Dec 13, 2013 and continues to survey 100% of the sky
with 2 bands. The releases listed above correspond to these various
time periods.<P> 


<h3>Terminology</h3>

WISE obtained images at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 microns
(also referred to as W1, W2, W3, and W4, respectively) with spatial
resolution ranging from 6 arcseconds at the shortest wavelength to 12
arcseconds at the longest. <P>

Individual exposure WISE images are assembled into Atlas tiles 1.564
degrees on a side. The WISE image server does not re-mosaic these
tiles. The degree of overlap between tiles is a function of
ecliptic latitude. You can obtain all Atlas tiles on which your object
appears, or individual exposures. Atlas tiles have point source
profiles whose full width at half max (FWHM) is sqrt(2) times larger
than the native (single-exposure) values. (See Explanatory Supplement
for more details.) Also note that WISE images are in DN, not in
absolute flux units.<P> 

Various sets of WISE images and corresponding catalog data are
available for download. Please consult the corresponding Explanatory
Supplement for the data set you choose to use. <P>

This is the IRSA/WISE Image Service.<P>

Search results are displayed in your browser in several sub-windows,
sometimes referred to as "panes", like "window panes."<P>


<h3>Searching, Results, and Filters</h3>

Several search options are provided, which are documented in more
detail <a href="searching.html">in the Searching section</A>. 
Searching by position is the most popular search. If you want more
frames than just the most centered result of your search, be sure to
set "Return only the most centered image containing the target" to
no.  <P>

A list of the search results appears in a table in the top right pane
of the search results window. These include basic information about
all the WISE images which fulfill your search criteria. Note that
there will be a separate table entry for each WISE band, so the total
number of images in the table will (generally) be four times the
number of WISE framesets or coadds available for the queried region.
Different tabs here correspond to different products selected for the
search. Catalogs can also appear as additional tabs here. <P>

An indication of each image's footprint on the sky can be found in the
upper left window pane, with red polygons on top of an IRAS 100 um
image. <P>

Along the bottom of the search results window are the WISE images
corresponding to the search results selected in the upper right. The
actual FITS images are shown; for more on how to interact with them,
see the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A>.<P>

The listed FITS images can be downloaded from the results pane by
checking the box at the beginning of each row, or selecting the
checkbox at the top of that column to 'select all', and clicking
"Prepare download".  See the page on the <a
href="basics.html#download">Background Monitor</A> for more
information.<P>

Filters, either imposed on your initial search or via <a
href="results.html#filter">your results page</A>, can provide a
powerful tool for narrowing down search results to the observations
you want.  For example, you can restrict your initial search to just
one channel by unclicking the other bands. After a search, by clicking
the "Add Filters" box in the results table pane, filter boxes appear
above each column in the results pane. It is possible to filter down
your search results to, e.g., just one channel. Filters are also
available for <a href="catalog.html#filters">catalog results</A>.<P>

<h3>Catalogs</h3>

Catalogs from IRSA, including the WISE catalogs accompanying each WISE
data delivery, can be downloaded using this interface. You can also
upload catalogs from disk. You can overlay catalogs on displayed
images, and make interactive plots with them. See the <a
href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A> for more information.<P>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

The images that are shown in the upper left and along the bottom of
the search results page are real FITS files.  There are tools for,
e.g., changing the color table and stretch, as well as annotating
those images. See <a href="visualization.html">the visualization
page</A> for more on visualization.<P>

Note that the native resolution for WISE band 4 (W4) is half that of
W1 (12 versus 6 arcsec), and the coadd Atlas tile resolution is
approximately sqrt(2) times worse than that for single frames in all
bands. See the Explanatory Supplement for more details. <P>

<h3>Downloading Data</h3>

After deciding which data to download, click on the corresponding
checkbox on the left side, or select the checkbox at the top of the
column to 'select all.' Click "Prepare Download" to begin the
packaging and data download process -- the download then gets passed
to a background job for packaging.  See <a
href="basics.html#download">the page on the Background Monitor</A> for
more information.<P>

<h3>User Preferences</h3>

The IRSA/WISE Image Service can remember you
and your <a href="basics.html#preferences">preferences</A> when you
return.  See the <a href="user.html">user registration page</A> for
more information.<P>
