<h2>Searching the IRSA/WISE Image Service</h2>

There are five main options for searching the IRSA/WISE Image
Service. Searching by position is the most commonly-used
option.  <P>

<A NAME="commonoptions"><H3>Options Common to Most Searches</H3></A>

The individual search options are given below, in the same order in
which they appear in the search pane.  Most of the search panes have
the following additional options.<P>

Each of the "Search" panes ask for the "Return Image size". Returned
images can be up to 2 degrees (or the equivalent in arcsec and arcmin)
on a side. <b>Hint:</b> choose your units first, then enter the
number. If you enter a number and then change the units, then the
computer converts the number you have entered into the new units.<P>

Although all four WISE wavelength bands (3.4, 4.6, 12, 22 microns) are
returned by default, if available, it is possible to select a subset
of them using the check boxes.  <P>

After you search the first time and are presented with the results
page, simply click the blue "Searches" tab to subsequently modify and
repeat your search. <P>

The Preliminary All-Sky and Preliminary Post-Cryo Data Release
Products are hidden by default because they have been superceded by
more recent releases. However, these may be still accessed in lieu of
the recommended product versions by selecting the <em>Obselete
preliminary release data</em> triangle for additional options in the
search pages. <p>


<A NAME="byPosition"><H3>Position Search</H3></A>

This search is the most common search performed on astronomical
archives.  Enter your central position, and all observations meeting
the rest of your entered criteria are returned.<P>

You may enter a target name, and have either NED or Simbad resolve the
target name into coordinates.  Alternatively, you may enter
coordinates directly. These coordinates can be in decimal degrees,  in
hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss, or hh mm ss dd mm ss format. By default, it assumes
you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can also specify galactic,
ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>

As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, it echoes back to
you what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which
you are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.  <P><P>

<A NAME="byTable"><b>Searching via "batch mode"</b></A><P>     The
position search can also be executed in "batch mode" for a list of
objects given in a file -- select the Multi-Object tab and use the
"Browse" button to locate the file with the list on your disk.  The
file must be in IPAC table format, which is basically ASCII text with
headers explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by
vertical bars.  

A sample input file looks like this: <P>
<pre>

</pre><P>
 

Please use the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank"> IPAC table validator <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> to check and reformat your
input table before the table upload. If the table upload search still
does not work properly, the most common errors are: 1. No hyphen
allowed in column names. 2. Column names should be all in lower case.
3. No characters in the file after the last pipe (|) in the column
header lines. 4. No empty lines at the end of the input file. 5. If
all else fails, change "RA" to "ra" and "Dec" to "dec" (or the
reverse).<p>

Note that there is a <strong>maximum number of 1000 objects</strong>
allowed for a single batch search.<P>

<h3>Search options after single/multi-object</h3>

For both single- and multi-object searches, the next option is whether
to return images that contain the target, image(s) that cover the
entire search region, image(s) that are entirely enclosed by the
search region, or image(s) that contain any pixel overlapping the
search region.<P>

For both single- and multi-object searches, you can set the size of
the image returned. You may enter the radius in arcseconds,
arcminutes, or degrees; just change the pulldown option accordingly.
<strong>Caution:</strong> pick your units from the pulldown first, and
then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from the
pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to the new
units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search radius; it
will tell you if you request something too big or too small.<P>

For both single- and multi-object searches, you also need to select
the Image Set to search : AllWISE, All-Sky (4-band Cryo), 3-Band Cryo,
Post-Cryo (2-band), or NEOWISE Reactivation (2-band) as well as the
desired product level: coadded Atlas images, Single Exposure (Level
1b) frames, or both. <P>


Using the "Return only the most centered image containing the target"
option, you can control how many image sets are returned. Individual
exposure WISE images are co-added into Atlas tiles 1.564 degrees on a
side. The WISE image server does not re-mosaic these tiles. The degree
of overlap between tiles is a function of declination. You can obtain
all Atlas tiles on which your object appears, or just the one most
closely centered on your object. (NB: If you select all the image sets,
and leave "most centered" set to 'yes', then you will only get the
image set that is most centered, not the most centered <em>per
set</em> which may not be what you want.)<P>

This option also enables you to select individual, single exposures;
again, you can select all of them or just the one most closely
centered on your object. Keep in mind, again, that if you pick
multiple releases or sets, if "most centered image" is set to yes, you
really will only get the most centered image, not the most centered
image <em>per release.</em> <P>

Also note that Atlas tiles have point source profiles whose full width
at half max (FWHM) is sqrt(2) times larger than the native
(single-exposure) values. (See Explanatory Supplement for more
details.)<P>

<!-- Note that if you are interested in retrieving <strong>all</strong> the
single exposure frames (or atlas tiles) that contain your target, as
opposed to just the most centered ones, you will need to set "Return
only the most centered image containing the target" to "no". <P> -->


<A NAME="bySSO"><H3>Solar System Object/Orbit (all-sky)</H3></A>

It is also possible to search for specific Solar System objects in the
single-frame WISE images. The search can be performed for comets or
asteroids using the object name or the six orbital parameters supplied
by the user either individually or in the Minor Planet Center (MPC)
one-line element format. <p>

In all cases, what the system is doing is using IRSA's <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/MOST/"
target="_blank">Moving Object Search Tool (MOST) <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, taking the orbital ephemeris
(either searching for the ephemeris based on the name that you enter,
or taking the orbital information you give it), calculating where the
object was over the time range that you request (over the entire
mission if date constraints are left blank), identifying the
individual exposures in which it calculates that your object should be
present, and returning to you all those exposures.<P>


As a result, <strong>requests over long time baselines can take a long
time.</strong> In fact, you can make a request that takes so much time
that it times out, and you get no search results. In order to shorten
search times, ask it to search over a smaller time baseline. The
NEOWISE data volume grows ever bigger, so searching the entire archive
takes longer and longer.<P>


<p>Solar System Object/Orbit Search Types:<P>

<dl>
  
  <dt><strong>Object Name</strong>: 
  <dd>You can search by object names by entering the name in the
"Object Name" field. It looks up the NAIF ID for you; select the NAIF
ID corresponding to your object.  The accepted naming conventions are
the ones that have been approved for use by the <a 
href="http://www.ss.astro.umd.edu/IAU/csbn/" target="_blank">CSBN <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> and its predecessors. News
reports occasionally use unofficial or unapproved names; you cannot
use these names to access objects.  For asteroid names, one can enter
either the ID number, name or designation, e.g. 2, 887, 1917, Pallas,
Alinda, Cuyo, 1981 QB, 1996 GQ, or 2010 CG18.  It can also handle
names with apostrophes and dashes like O'Connell and Pic-du-Midi.  For
comet names, one can enter either the whole name e.g. 10P/Tempel 2,
73P-B/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, P/2009 WJ50, or P/2010 D1 or just the
unique part of its name e.g. 10P, 73P-B, 2009 WJ50, or 2010 D1. <P> 

<dt><strong>MPC Input OR Manual Input</strong>: 
<dd>The standard six orbital elements for asteroid are
<em>eccentricity, semimajor axis, mean anomaly, inclination, longitude
of the ascending node,</em> and <em>argument of perihelion</em>. For comets,
the elements are <em>eccentricity, perihelion distance, time of
perihelion passage, inclination, longitude of the ascending node,</em> and
<em>argument of perihelion</em>. Notice that for comets, <em>perihelion
distance</em> is used instead of <em>semimajor axis</em> and <em>time
of perihelion passage</em> is used instead of <em>mean anomaly</em>.
The reason for replacing these two parameters is to allow for cases
where long period comets have a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit. 
A good description of the orbital parameters is given in JPL's <a
target="_blank" href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?faq">Solar System
Dynamics website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a>.<p>

You can search for objects by either inputting the orbital parameters
by hand or by using a properly-formatted Minor Planet Center input
string.  This latter option allows the user to cut-and-paste a line
directly from a table of orbital elements in <a
href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Ephemerides/Soft00.html"
target="_blank">MPC Format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> into the search field. There are a
number of orbital element tables available at the MPC website, for
example, <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Ephemerides/Unusual/Soft00Unusual.txt">observable
NEO <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> and <a
href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/Soft00Cmt.txt"
target="_blank">observable comets <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10">.</a> The complete list of minor
planets can be found at the <a
href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPCORB.html"
target="_blank">MPC Orbit (MPCORB) Database <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10">.</a> 

 <p>Information on the format of the element tables is given by
following sites: <a

<p>Additional constraints for Solar System objects:<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observation Begin/End (UT)</strong>:  Allows the search to
  be constrained to a given time range. If left blank, it searches
  over the whole mission. <strong>Caution:</strong> Searches over long
  time baselines can take a long time.<p>

<li><strong>Return Image Size</strong>: Specifies the size of the image
  to be returned.  The pull-down menu is used to select the units in
  which to express this size.  Leave the field blank to obtain 
  the full WISE exposures (0.78x0.78 deg).<p>

<li><strong>Overlay Catalog</strong> and <strong>Search
radius</strong>: If this option is selected, in addition to returning
the indivdual exposure images, the system will also search (and
return) the catalogs derived from the individual exposures. The search
radius defines the radius over which the system should search in each
exposure's catalog. Note that, since not all objects are in all image
sets (and corresponding catalogs), you may get catalog errors when
using this feature.  <p>

<li><strong>Image Set</strong>: There are 4 image sets of relevance to
Solar System searches: All-Sky (4-band), 3-band Cryo, Post-Cryo
(2-band), and NEOWISE-R. Each image set has a different set of
accompanying catalogs. If you ask it to overlay catalogs (prior
line), it will search the catalogs corresponding to each of the image
sets you select here.<p>

<li><strong>Return the following bands</strong>: You can restrict
the output to any combination of the four WISE bands.<p>

</ul>


<A NAME="byScanID"><H3>ScanID/Frame, Coadd ID, Source ID (all-sky)</H3></A>

Instead of searching by individual positions, you may also search the
all-sky WISE archive for individual single-exposure framesets (Level
1b),  coadded Atlas images (Level 3), or images containing a given
WISE catalog source. Typically, these identifications are derived from
the WISE source catalogs.  The Scan ID/Frame specifies an individual
set of WISE frames, and Coadd ID identifies a set of coadded images
constructed from combining a set of frames. The Source ID search
allows the user to  search for either the specific image from which a
WISE source was extracted or all images which contain a given WISE
source.  <p>

The names of WISE scan/frame images  (scan_id) are  constructed from
the five digit (+ either a, b, c, d, or e) scan (observation)  code
followed by the number of the frame in the sequence of images. For
example, to search for "01432a010" which indicates image frame number
"10" in the scan "01432a", enter "01432a" (note that the leading zero
is required) in the text box for "Scan ID(s)" and "10" in the text box
for "Frame Number(s)". <p>

The CoAdd ID identifies the tile on the sky represented by the coadded
image. It is formed from the RA * 10, the sign of the Dec, the
declination * 10, and the string "aa11" for the Preliminary Release 
and "ab41" or "ab42" for the All-Sky Release. The Source ID is a
unique source name constructed from the CoAdd ID plus the number of
the source within the coadd.  The CoAdd IDs and Source IDs are given
by the <tt>coadd_id</tt> and <tt>source_id</tt>  columns in the Long
Form version of the IRSA Gator Query interface  (under the Column
Constraints/Output Column Selection area  at the bottom of the query
page) need to be explicitly selected by you. For example, for the QSO
3C 273, these values are <tt>coadd_id = 1875p014_ab41</tt> and
<tt>source_id = 1875p014_ab41-033361</tt>. <p>

When searching based on CoAdd ID or Source ID you no longer need to
select the image sets, as those are now automatically selected from the
Source ID. Note: queries using the preliminary data products will
still need to supply the image sets.<P>
