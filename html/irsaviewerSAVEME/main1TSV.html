<h2>Time Series Tool: Main Screen, Viewer (Initial View)</h2>


After you load in a time series, you get a screen where you are
presented with several different panes: settings, table, plot, and
images, highlighted in the screen shot below. The table, plot, and
images are all connected in that clicking in one changes things in the
others.

<h3><A NAME="settings">Settings</A></h3>

This box in the upper left controls the time series with which you are
working. For WISE/NEOWISE, you can view measurements as a function of
time, simultaneously visualize the single-epoch images, and optionally
find the period of variability. For other data sets, visualization of
the single-epoch images is not currently available, but period
analysis is available. <P>

The upper left starts with the file you have uploaded, followed by the
mission you have selected. Then it has a place to enter the time and
time-dependent column.<P>

For WISE/NEOWISE time series, it assumes that the time column you want
is "mjd", and the time-dependent variable column is "w1mpro_ep". You
can change this to any of the other 3 WISE channels (w2mpro_ep,
w3mpro_ep, w4mpro_ep). You can change both of these to be any other
column in the catalog.  <P>

For PTF time series, it assumes that the time column you want
is "obsmjd", and the time-dependent variable column is "mag_autocorr".
You can change both of these to be any other
column in the catalog.  <P>

If you have uploaded your own time series, you can control which
columns are plotted (and eventually <a href="findpTSV.html">sent to
the period-finding function</A>) from this settings pane. 
If it finds a column called MJD, mjd, BJD, bjd, or really
anything followed by "jd", it will assume that is your time column. It
doesn't know how to assume your dependent variable column. If there is
only one other column, it grabs that as the dependent variable. If you
have many columns, you may need to help it realize what column should
be the dependent variable. <P>

The bottom left of this box has a button, "Period Finder", which
launches period finding; see <a href="findpTSV.html">Period
Finding</A>.<P>

The upper right of this box controls the images displayed, if the
images are displayed at all.<P>

By default, for WISE/NEOWISE time series, it displayes the W1 images
at the bottom of the window (see <a href="#images">images</A>, below).
To have different WISE images displayed (for any column in the
uploaded table, not just another WISE magnitude), click on the radio
buttons. <P>

The "cutout size" controls the size of these image cutouts.<P>



<h3><A NAME="table">Table</A></h3>

Just below the settings pane is a pane with the data table displayed.
This is the time series you have uploaded into the tool. <P>

The table, if very long, is divided into 'pages' you can scroll
through. You can filter and sort the table. You can control which
columns are shown. For a more complete introduction to this tool's
table manipulation functions, please see the <a
href="tables.html">Tables section</A>.<P>

<strong>Quick start: Sorting.</strong> Click on any column heading to
sort the table by that column in ascending order; click it again to
make it descending order, or click it a 3rd time to return the table
to the unsorted state.<P>

The table comes up, by default, sorted by the time column you have
selected in the <a href="#settings">settings pane</A>.<P>

After you run <a href="findpTSV.html">Period Finding</A>, there will
be another table loaded in to this pane. See the section on <a
href="main2TSV.html">main screen, after period finding</A>.<P>


<h3><A NAME="plot">Plot</A></h3>

On the upper right, there is a plot of the input light curve you have
loaded into the tool. It takes the time and dependent variable you
have selected in the <a href="#settings">settings pane</A>. If you
change the settings pane, this plot changes. If you have &gt; 50,000
points in your light curve, the plot will be binned, e.g., show the
light curve as a density plot, where each bin can represent multiple
points.<P>

You can change what is plotted and how it is plotted. You can add
error bars. For a more complete introduction to this tool's plotting
functions, please see the <a href="plots.html">Plots
section</A>.<P>

<strong>Quick start: Adding errors.</strong> To add error bars to the
plot of the light curve, click on the gears (<img
src="img/tableoptions.png">) to bring up options for the table:<br>
<img src="img/tableoptionspopupTSV.png"><P> From here, you can tell it
which column of your catalog  to use for the error bars. Note that the
errors you add to this plot are for display purposes only and are not
used in subsequent period finding. <P>

"Apply" to implement your changes, "close" to exit without further
changes. You can also click on the 'x' in the upper right to remove this pop-up.<P>



<h3><A NAME="images">Images</A></h3>

<strong>Purpose</strong><P>

The purpose of having each image from each epoch displayed is to look
for any irregularities (instrumental or otherwise) on or near your
target in each individual exposure. <P>

<strong>Default view</strong><P>

If you have loaded in a WISE/NEOWISE or PTF time series, on the bottom
of the screen there is a set of 5 images. Each of these images is
centered on your target, and is of the cutout size specified in the <a
href="#settings">settings pane</A>. Note that if you change the time
series to be, say, "w2mpro_ep", the images will NOT automatically
change to WISE-2; you must control what images are shown by clicking
the radio buttons near the words "image display" near the top of the
window.<P>

<strong>Dynamic Linking</strong> <P>

The images are dynamically linked to the table and the
plot. Click on a row of the table, and the images (and plot)
change; the image in the center of the row of 5 corresponds to the
table row you have selected. Click on a point in the plot, and images
(and table) change; the image in the center of the row of 5
corresponds to the plot point you have selected.  <em>If you change
the sort order of the table</em> to, say, sort by brightness, then the
order of the images also changes. (This will become more important
after you run <a href="findpTSV.html">Period Finding</A>.) <P>

<strong>Image Displays</strong><P>

The text immediately above the images reminds you how you have sorted
the table, and whether it is ascending or descending.<P>

You can control whether 1, 3, 5, or 7 images are displayed in the
sequence. <P>

You can control the size of the image cutouts in the settings box on
the top left.<P>

The upper left corner of each image reminds you which survey, channel,
exposure, size, and zoom you are using.<P>

By default, the tool loads with each image centered on your target.
Some targets are on the edge of WISE exposures, so the image may not
fill the entire image box for each epoch. To turn this feature off,
unclick the "Target Match" box near the upper right of the images
pane.<P>

<strong>Image Interactions</strong><P>

When you interact with these images, you are interacting with the FITS
files, so you can change the color table and stretch, measure
distances, etc.  For a more comprehensive introduction to this tool's
image manipulations functions, please see the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A>.<P>

<strong>Quick start: Changing the color table or stretch.</strong> <P>

To change the color table, go up to the image toolbar near the top of
the window. Click on the color table icon (<img
src="img/colortable.png">) and select a new color table from the
options presented. Similarly, for the color stretch, click on the
color stretch icon (<img src="img/stretch.png">) and select a new
color stretch from the options presented.<P>
