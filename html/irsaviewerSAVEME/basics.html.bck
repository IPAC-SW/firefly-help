<h2>IRSA Viewer: Basic Features and Functions </h2>

You can initiate the IRSA Viewer by loading the tool directly from the
icon on the home page, or by clicking on a link that looks like this:
<img src="img/viewerlaunch.png">. If the you have loaded the tool
directly, the first time you see the IRSA Viewer, it does not have an
image pre-loaded; if you have clicked the icon to launch it, the first
time you see the IRSA Viewer, it already has an image loaded.<P> The
contents of this section essentially follow the menu options for the
IRSA Viewer (e.g., basically the blue tabs across the top, under the
IRSA menu) and major features of the tool in the order in which you
might encounter them.<br> <img src="img/bluetabs.png"><p>


Besides the online help (also available as a pdf; see top right), note
that there are also IRSA Viewer Tool and Catalog Search Tool video
tutorials, including  quick start and longer AAS-demo style overviews,
available at the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>.  Also see the IRSA Viewer playlist (which collects
all the IRSA Viewer tutorials together), as well as the playlist of
tutorials relevant for more than one archive.<P>

<h3><A NAME="searching">Searching for and Loading Images</A></h3>

When you first start the IRSA Viewer, depending on how you get into
it, either an image is pre-loaded, or the first screen you come to is
a position search for images. If the image is pre-loaded, you can
start manipulating the image right away; see <a
href="visualization.html">the Visualization section</A>. If,
however, you do not have an image pre-loaded, you will need to select
an image to load.<P>

If you do not have an image pre-loaded, the default start position is
in the position search for images. It is assuming by default that you
want to load an image from IRSA services, though you can also load an
image from disk or off another service on the web (see below).  <P>

The search window looks like this:<br>
<img src="img/search.png" width="70%">
<P>

<strong>First</strong>, you select which images you want to load: FITS
images (individually), FITS images that you load into a new
three-color image, or <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A&A...578A.114F/abstract"
target="_blank">HiPS images <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> (also see <a
href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/HiPS/" target="_blank">IVOA docs
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>). (More on <a
href="#3-color">3-color images</A> and <a href="#hips">HiPS</A>
below.)<P>

<strong>Second</strong>, you select whether you want to pull an image
from IRSA's archives ("Search"; see below), your own disk ("Use my
image"), elsewhere on the web ("URL"), or the IRSA <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">Workspace <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> ("Workspace"). Note that to use
the Workspace (reading from or writing to it), you'll need to <a
href="user.html">log in</A>. <P>

In the cases other than "Search", nearly all of the additional options
below this line vanish because they are no longer relevant. To
<strong>select an image off of your local disk</strong>, select "Use
my image", and then tell it where to find the image on your local
disk. To load an <strong>image from the web</strong>, pick the "URL"
option and enter the URL from which you want an image loaded.  To load
an <strong>image from the IRSA Workspace</strong>, pick the
"Workspace" option and find the file you want to load.<P>

If you would like to load an image from IRSA's archives, select
"Search" and go on to these subsequent additional search
parameters.<P>

<strong>Third</strong>, you select a target. You may enter a target
name, and have either NED-then-Simbad  or Simbad-then-NED resolve the
target name into coordinates.  Alternatively, you may enter
coordinates directly. These coordinates can be in decimal degrees or
in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format. By default, it assumes you are working in
J2000 coordinates; you can also specify galactic, ecliptic, or B1950
coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>
Examples are given below the text entry box before you start typing in
the box.<P>

As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, it echoes back to
you what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which
you are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.  <P>

Below the box where you enter the target, you can then specify the
size of the images you want.  You may enter the cutout size in
arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees; just change the pulldown option
accordingly. <strong>Caution:</strong> pick your units from the
pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and
then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the
old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to
your search size; it will tell you if you request something too big
or too small. Note that these limits may be image-dependent; larger
images may be available from certain surveys and smaller images may be
available from other surveys. <strong>If you want the whole image
tile</strong>, just leave the image size blank, then the closest image
tile in its entirety will be returned. <P>


<strong>Fourth</strong>, you select the data set. There are myriad
choices, which you can filter in various ways to allow you to find
what you need. Statistically, any one spot on the sky will only be
found in a few of these data sets, so it makes sense to weed down the
list, at least a little bit.<P>

<em>On the left hand side</em>, you can filter by :
<DL>
<DT>Mission (or survey)
<DD>Spitzer, WISE, Herschel, 2MASS, IRAS, ZTF, PTF, AKARI, DSS, SDSS, MSX,
COSMOS, MUSYC, BLAST, IRTS, BOLOCAM.
<DT>Project Type 
<dd>Compilation (meaning, e.g., all the data available from a mission
that was not an all-sky survey), extragalactic, galactic, all-sky. 
<dt>Band 
<dd>X-ray, UV, optical, near-IR, mid-IR, far-IR, mm, radio. (Yes, you
can find data from non-IR missions/surveys here, depending on what
projects have delivered back to IRSA.)
</DL>
To expand or contract the options
below each of these broad categories, click on the black arrow on the
left. To see all of the choices in each of these broad categories,
click on the black arrow and then click "more" near the bottom of the
list. To select any of the options, click on the checkbox on the left.
In response to your selections, two things happen. (1) checked items
appear in red italics above this part of the page, underneath "filter
by"; (2) the list of programs for selection on the right hand side
changes.<P>

<em>On the right hand side</em>, you can select individual surveys and
individual bands therein. To expand or contract the options below each
of the categories, click on the black arrow on the left. To select any
of the waveband options, click on the checkbox on the left of the
individual survey or individual bands.<P>

To find out more information about any given data set, click on the i
in the circle. This takes you to a master list of all data sets
available in IRSA Viewer, from which you can obtain standard
information about the data sets (mission, wavlengths, links to more
information about the program or delivery, and more). <P>

To actually complete the task as requested, choose the "Search" button
in the lower left.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting</strong>.
<UL>
<LI>You don't have to select something on the left side before
selecting something on the right side. If you know exactly what you
want, just jump in and select things on the right and click "search."
<LI>If you select something on the left side, it will limit your
choices accordingly on the right side. 
<LI>If you clear filters on the left side, it doesn't affect
selections you've made on the right. You must "clear filters" (on the
left) and "clear selections" (on the right) to remove all filters and
return to the initial state.
<LI>If you want to expand all the choices on the right (to ease in
band selection), click "expand all" to show all options, or "collapse
all" to collapse them again.
<LI>For more information on the data sets included in IRSA Viewer, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/irsaviewer_datasets.html"
target="_blank">this list <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.
<LI>IRSA Viewer will NOT return not ALL the images for your specified
combination of dataset+band+position; it returns the most centered
science image it can find. This is usually but not always actually
going to be the most useful to you, depending on what you're trying to
do.  Some programs delivered PSFs, mosaics created with alternate
algorithms, etc.  To find all the data at IRSA for a given target,
enter the position in the big search box on the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">IRSA home page
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (this accesses a tool
called Data Discovery), or navigate specifically to the page
corresponding to your desired data set and search there by position
(this accesses a tool called Atlas). 
</UL>

Example: I want all data covering M16. M16, the Eagle Nebula, is
essentially in the galactic plane. Thus, I don't need to search really
any of the extragalactic data sets. I select on the left hand side,
under project type, compilation, galactic, and all-sky. I am still
left with a long list of programs (though it is much shorter than it
was before). However, I can omit some programs from consideration
based on their names -- programs studying Taurus or Orion are unlikely
to have any data on M16. I can then individually select the dozen or
so data sets likely to cover M16.<P>

<strong>Adding new images</strong>. Additional images can be added
after an initial search by clicking on the blue "Images" tab near the
top left. The resulting window resembles the initial search window. 
You can use the same target as before, or change the target. To close
the search window without getting a new image, click on "cancel" in
the lower left.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting.</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>If you go back to add new images of the same target, be sure to
uncheck the images you had previously selected, otherwise you will
load in second copies of those images. 
<LI>To remove an image you have already loaded (or an error message
from a program that had no data covering your target), click on the
small blue "x" in the upper right of the corresponding image tile. 
</UL>
Much more detail about interacting with images can be found in the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A>.
<P>


<h3><A NAME="3-color">Making 3-color Images</A></h3>

You can create 3-color images directly from the image search screen.
Select "Create 3-Color Composite" from the top row of options. The
rest of the pop-up changes to look like the following:<br>
<img src="img/3colors.png" width="70%"><P>
By default, you can select the red plane first; you then populate that
color plane with all the same choices as you would have for a single
channel image. To set the additional color planes, click on "green"
and then "blue" to populate those planes accordingly.  <p>

It assumes that you must want the same position for all three color
planes.<P>

Select your options individually for each color plane (red, green,
blue), and click 'Search' in the lower left. Click 'Cancel' to
cancel.<P>

To change the color stretch of each color plane individually, click on
the "Color Stretch" icon in the toolbox on the top of the IRSA Viewer
window; see the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization
section</A>. Much more detail about interacting with images can be
found in the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization
section</A>.<P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting.</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>You load all three images at once, e.g., you do NOT pick red,
click search, then go back and pick green, click search, then go back
and pick blue, click search. Instead, click red and define what you
want for that image, then go to green and do the same, then go to blue
and do the same. Don't click "search" until you have specified all
three bands.
<LI> The images will be downsampled to the resolution of the red
image. If you, say, load an MSX image into the red plane, a WISE image
into the green plane, and a 2MASS image into the blue plane, all of
the images will have MSX-sized pixels. If you load a WISE image into
the red and green planes, and a 2MASS image into the blue plane, the
images will have WISE-sized pixels. 
<LI>You have to set the size of the image separately on each color
plane. It does not automatically assume you want the same size of
sky covered. <P>
</UL>


<h3><A NAME="hips">HiPS Images</A></h3>

<a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A&A...578A.114F/abstract"
target="_blank">HiPS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
stands for hierarchical progressive surveys, and these kinds of images
are multi-resolution <a href="http://healpix.sourceforge.net/"
target="_blank">HEALPix <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>
images (where HEALPix stands for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude
Pixelation). (Also see <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/documents/HiPS/"
target="_blank">IVOA docs on HiPS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>.) In pratice, what this means in practice is that you
can interact with images of a very large chunk of sky, and as you
zoom, the pixel size changes dynamically. <P>

Select "View HiPS Images" from the top row of options. The
rest of the pop-up changes to look like the following:<br>
<img src="img/hips.png" width="70%"><P>

<strong>First</strong>, you tell it whether you want to search
among the HiPS images available to this tool, or at a URL. <P>

<strong>Second</strong>, give it a target; this works as for FITS
images above.<P>

<strong>Third</strong>, you need to pick an image size. If you leave
the image size blank, the whole HiPS image will be loaded. Note that
the field of view (FOV) here is large; it can be no smaller than
0.0025 deg, and can be up to 180 degrees. Here, again, pick the units
first, and then enter the number.<P>

<strong>Fourth</strong>, select a data set. By default, the list of
possible choices is limited (via the checkbox at the top of the table)
to "IRSA Featured" choices, meaning data that IRSA users are most
likely to want. If you uncheck this box, you will have a much larger
list of HiPS image choices (from <a href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/"
target="_blank">CDS <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>) to
load.  <P>

<strong>Tips and Troubleshooting.</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>The table of choices is like all the other <a
href="tables.html">tables in this tool</A>, so you
can sort/filter/etc. to locate the image you want to load. If you
click the gears in the upper right of the table, you can change the
table characteristics and impose filters on columns, or you can turn
on the option to impose filters via the boxes on the tops of each
column. 
<LI>To learn more about any given image, click on the i with a circle
around it in the second column of the table. Another window will spawn
with basic information about that HiPS image.
<LI>Note that color HiPS images are available and that the color
stretch is set by the person making the HiPS image
originally (so you can't change it). You can change the color table
(but not the stretch); see the <a
href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A>.
<LI>A blank HiPS image (basically a blank canvas) is also available in
the list of HiPS images.
</UL>
<P>

<strong>Column definitions.</strong> The table that appears when
selecting a HiPS image has several columns:
<UL>
<LI>Type - image (all that is available in this context)
<LI>Properties - links to more information for that image
<LI>Title - descriptive words for the HiPS image
<LI>Waveband - Approximate wavelength range
<LI>Coverage - sky coverage (100% or less) -- this is sometimes
referred to as "MOC", or multi-order coverage.
<LI>Pixel scale - At the highest order (zoomed in the most), this is
the pixel size
<LI>HiPS Order - HiPS order, e.g., how deep you can zoom
<LI>Frame - coordinate sytem, e.g., equatorial, galactic, etc.
<LI>Release date - Date that HiPS image became available
<LI>Dataset IVOA ID - Unique (worldwide) identifier for the dataset
</UL>


<h3><A NAME="images">Interacting with Images</A></h3>

The <a href="visualization.html">Visualization section</A> has
much more information about interacting with images.<P>

Once any image appears in your browser window, let your mouse
hover any portion of the image. Details about the image and the
portion of the image under your mouse cursor appear in the upper
right:<br>
<img src="img/pixelreadout.png"><P>

The upper left of the loaded image tells you basic things about the
image you are viewing. The telescope and/or instrument and/or data
release is in black. The field of view is in green font; this
corresponds to the (horizontal) width of the image window.<P>

<img src="img/iraclabel.png"> <img src="img/uvlabel.png"> Two examples
of image labels. The former is from Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products
(SEIP), IRAC channel 2, and the field of view is 11 arcmin. The latter
is far-ultraviolet (FUV) data delivered by the Local Volume Legacy
(LVL) project, and the field of view is 6.8 arcmin.<P>

<img src="img/multiplanelabel.png"> Images can have multiple planes;
the blue arrows shown here allow you to page through the planes. (This
is from the HerMES project and is Herschel SPIRE 350 micron data.)<P>


<h3><A NAME="tables"><A NAME="catalogs">Interacting with Tables and Catalogs</A></A></h3>

The <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> has
much more information about interacting with tables in general.<P>

The <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A> has much more
information about interacting specifically with catalogs, including
searhing for them.<P>

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs (from IRSA,
your own disk, the VO, or NED) to load and overlay on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. <P>



<h3><A NAME="plots"><A NAME="charts">Charts</A></A> --  Making additional plots</h3>

By default, when you load a <a href="catalogs.html">catalog</A>, you
get an x-y plot displayed as well. The "Charts" tab allows you to
create additional plots. See the <a href="plots.html">Plots
section</A> for lots more information.<P>


<h3><A NAME="help">Getting Help</A></h3>

The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. There are also
context-sensitive help markers throughout the tools (<img
src="img/help.png">).  You can also download a PDF version of this
manual; look at the top of the help window. (The PDF may be easier to
search than the web pages; use your PDF reader's search function.) <P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk/"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

A set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the IRSA Viewer is <a

<a name="bugs"></A><strong>Found a bug?</strong> The known bugs and
issues in this version of the IRSA Viewer are listed <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/irsaviewerbugslist.html"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  If
you think you have found a bug, before reporting it, please check this
list, and read this online IRSA Viewer help. It may be a "feature" we
already know about.  If you have found a new, real bug, then please do
contact us via the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>. Please include your operating system version and
your browser software and version.  If you can, please also include
any specific error message you may have gotten. (NB: In our testing,
copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux; the command-C did not
work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the right mouse button
did.)<P>

<h3><A NAME="bgmon">Background Monitor</A></h3>

The Background Monitor appears as a blue tab (or button) in the upper
right of your window to keep track of the data downloads you have
requested.  It actively changes to reflect what it is doing (e.g.,
this is preparing a catalog: <img src="img/preparing.png">) Larger
catalog requests can be sent to the Background Monitor.  It also
provides a <a href="downloads.html#downloadScript">download script</A>
(optional) if you have more than one package to download.<P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" tab.  You can watch your data being retrieved.
It will update that window when the data are available for download
and/or overlay on your image, providing a link (or links) for obtaining
the data. It also keeps track of the downloads you have requested
during the same session, and indicates with a checkmark those that you
have already loaded. Remove them from the list by clicking on the blue
'x'. <br>
<img src="img/backgroundpopup.png"><img src="img/backgroundpopup2.png"><P>

If you have made, say, a large catalog request and don't want the
pending catalog request to occupy screen space while it loads, you can
click on the button marked "send to background" to reclaim your screen
space. When the background monitor finishes, however, you will have to
actively tell it to display results (it doesn't do it automatically).
You can ask it to send you email when it is ready. 
<P>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign") that appears next to the query in the Background Monitor
pop-up.<P>

If you forgot to put in your email at the beginning, or if the
packaging is taking longer than you expected, you can click on "Enable
email notification" from the bottom of the Background Monitor popup
and add your email during the packaging process. <P>
