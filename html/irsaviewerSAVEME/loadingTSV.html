<h2>Time Series Tool: Loading in a Time Series</h2>



When you launch the Time Series Tool, the first screen you encounter
is the screen in which you can upload a time series. <P>

<h3><A NAME="mainoptions">Main Options</A></h3>

You can use a file on your disk or in the IRSA <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.

In either case, click on the "Browse" button to find  the file on your
disk or in the workspace to upload into the tool.<P>

For "mission", you can choose "WISE/NEOWISE", "PTF", "ZTF", or "Other". <P>

<h3><A NAME="data">Data Sets Accepted</A></h3>

For WISE/NEOWISE and PTF/ZTF, you can view measurements as a function
of time, simultaneously visualize the single-epoch images, and
optionally find the period of variability. <P>

For other data sets, visualization of the single-epoch images is not
currently available, but period analysis is available.  <P>

<h3><A NAME="requirements">Table Requirements</A></h3>

<DL><DT><strong>WISE/NEOWISE</strong></dt><DD>

To load the single-epoch images, the WISE/NEOWISE table you upload
must have the columns frame_id and source_id, or both scan_id and
frame_num. (It needs those columns to be able to grab the
corresponding exposue image.) Catalogs obtained from IRSA's Catalog
Search Tool for the AllWISE multiepoch photometry catalog will work
transparently; catalogs from  Catalog Search Tool for other single
exposures <strong>need the long-form results</strong>, which include
these columns, and then these catalogs will also work transparently.
(Here is an <a href="exampleallwiseinput.tbl">example input table from
AllWISE</A>.)
<P>

<DT><strong>PTF and ZTF</strong></dt><DD>

To load the single-epoch images, the PTF or ZTF table you upload must
have the column "pid" included in your table. Catalogs obtained from 
IRSA's Catalog Search Tool for the PTF or ZTF light curve catalog will
work transparently. (Here is an <a href="exampleptfinput.tbl">example
input table from PTF</A>.) <P> 

</dl>


<h3><A NAME="formatting">Table Formatting</A></h3>

If you upload your own catalog, your catalog needs to be in <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>, which is a varietal of plain text. IRSA has a <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table validator <img
src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> which may be helpful, or you
can download just about any catalog you find through IRSA, and mimic
that format. <P>


<h3><A NAME="default">Default Columns</A></h3>

If you have a data table with an independent and dependent variable
(time and flux, time and temperature, position and color, whatever),
you should choose "Other" and you will still be able to work with your
data (it just won't be able to pull individual images for each data
point). If it finds a column called MJD, mjd, BJD, bjd, or really
anything followed by "jd", it will assume that is your time column. It
doesn't know how to assume your dependent variable column. If there is
only one other column, it grabs that as the dependent variable. If you
have many columns, you may need to help it realize what column should
be the dependent variable. <P>


<h3><A NAME="newtable">New Tables</A></h3>

You can retrieve this upload window at any time by clicking on the
blue "upload" button in the upper left. From here you can upload a new
table and start again.<P>


<h3><A NAME="cancel">Cancelling</A></h3>

Click "cancel" to cancel the upload.<P>
