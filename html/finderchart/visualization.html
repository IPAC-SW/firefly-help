<h2>Finder Chart: Visualization</h2>

The images meeting your search criteria are shown as the primary
results of the search, sorted by survey. The circle-with-crosshairs
overlaid by default is the search position you submitted. If you
searched on catalogs from the main front search page, then those
catalogs are also overlaid on your images. You can add and overlay
additional catalogs and add other layers to your image. Click on the
blue "Catalogs" tab near the top of the page to add more catalogs. See
the <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> for more on table
manipulation, and see the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A>
for more on catalogs. <P>

Critical to many of the functions described in this visualization
section is the concept of the "selected image."  Finder Chart can
return up to 34 images of the same patch of sky. Look at the array of
images returned by a search. One (you may have to look for it) is
"selected" -- it is outlined in orange. Click on a different image,
and that image becomes outlined in orange as the selected image. By
default, the Finder Chart images are locked together, so quite often
what you do to one image is done to all the images. But certain other
behaviors described here are still customized to each individual
image. <strong>In order to affect a given image, you must select
it.</strong> <P>

<H3><A NAME="fitsViewer">FITS Viewer</A></H3>

You can interactively explore the image with the mouse. Move your
mouse over any image that is loaded into the viewer. Details about the
image and, specifically, the pixel beneath your mouse cursor, appear
along the top of the window with a variety of useful items. Some
information is updated in real time (such as coordinates); some
information (such as flux densities) is updated when you stop moving
your mouse for a second or two.  The image can be interactively
investigated in this fashion.  <br> <img src="img/readout.png"><br>
You can make it 'stick' on a particular place on the image -- tick the
"Lock by click" box and then click on the image at your desired
location. <P>

The orientation of the image is given with a compass rose on the
right, next to a zoomed-in view of the image under your cursor. If you
can't see all of these two displays, enlarge your browser window
slightly.<P> 


&nbsp;<P>

<H3><A NAME="imageinfo">Image Information</A></H3>


The results are grouped by survey. The upper left of the loaded image
tells you basic things about the image you are viewing: the <a
href="overview.html#surveys">survey origin</A> (instrument, channel)
and, where possible, the date of observation. (Some images are coadds
from individual frames taken at different times, up to months or even
years, so a single date may be misleading. Investigate the FITS header
of the image using one of the other buttons below to obtain the
average date suggested by the producer of the FITS files.)<P>

<img src="img/2masslabel.png"> Example of image label.<P>


The target on which you searched is overlaid on the main image with a
cross-hair marker:<img src="img/target.png"> You can remove this (or
change its color) from the layers pop-up, described below.<P>

Some information (like the title of the image) is also given
in the interactive exploration region described immediately above.
This region also includes additional information about the image (such
as the pixel scale and orientation).<P>


<a name="imageoptions"> <!-- --> </A>
<h3><a name="toolbar">Image Toolbar (FITS and HiPS)</A></h3>

There is a toolbox along the top of the IRSA Viewer window:<br> <img
src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br> from which you can select a
variety of options, now described.  Letting your mouse hover over any of
these icons will result in a "tool tip" that appears in order to
remind you what the icon does. This information is also dynamically
updated just to the right of the toolbox itself.<P>

<DL>

<A NAME="fitsDownloadOptions"><!-- --></A>
<dt><img src="img/save.png"> <em>Saving the image.</em>
<dd>The diskette icon will allow you to save the current image.  You
can save files to your local disk or to the  <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace 
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  Note that
<b>you</b> control where the file is saved on your disk through your
browser; your browser may be configured to
store all downloads in a particular location on your disk.<P>

You can save images as FITS, PNG, or regions files to your local disk.
Saved FITS images will not save the color stretches or overlays; it
will just save the underlying FITS image.  Saved PNG files WILL
include any overlays or annotations you have placed on the image, but
will not include the underlying FITS image. Saved regions files will
not save the underlying image, but will just save the overlays as a
DS9 Regions file. See the <a
href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html" target="_blank">DS9
website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for more
information on the syntax of these DS9 region files. <P>

Note that you can save the original or a cropped version of the
FITS file; see the select region icon below to crop, and then save the
FITS image. Be sure to save the cropped FITS image (see annotated
figure). <br>
<img src="img/savecropped.png"> <P>  <P>

Note that if you <a href="catalogs.html">overlay a catalog</A>
consisting of tens of thousands of sources, then turn around and save
a regions file from the catalog overlay, then you will have fewer
sources in the regions file than you have in the full catalog. This is
a known issue.<P>

The saved PNG is the same size as it is on your screen. If you want a
big version, make the desired image big on your screen (view
one-at-a-time) before saving the PNG. <P>

<!-- <dt><img src="img/new3colorimg.png"> <em>New 3-color image.</em>  
<dd>Depending on what you have been doing in your session to this
point, you may have this icon immediately to the right of the 'save
image' icon. This icon allows you to change what color planes are used
for a given 3-color image. More about 3-color images can be found
<a href="#3color">in the 3-color section below</A>.<P> -->

<dt><img src="img/zoominout.png"> <em>Zooming in or out.</em>  
<dd>
Clicking on these magnifying glass icons zooms in or out of the image.
The readout of how many times you are zoomed appears at the top of the
visualization window.  <P>

If you click zoom in or out rapidly, a pop-up window appears to allow
you to more rapidly select the zoom level you want. Select the desired
level, or click on the 'x' in the upper right to make the window
go away. Here is an example: <br><img src="img/zoomlevel.png"><P>

Note that there is a maximum (or minimum) allowed zoom level. A
notification will appear when you have reached the maximum (or
minimum) allowed zoom level for a given image.  To enlarge things more
than that, please repeat your search to obtain new images with smaller
(or larger) spatial extent. <P>

<dt><img src="img/zoomoriginalsize.png"> <em>Zooming to a 1-to-1 size.</em>  
<dd> Clicking this icon will zoom the image such that one pixel in the
image is one pixel on your screen.  <P>

<dt><img src="img/fitandfill.png"> <em>Fit image to screen or fill
screen</em>  
<dd>
These two icons are designed to maximize the available space in your
browser window. The first one automatically picks a zoom level such
that the image entirely fits within the available space. The second
one automatically picks a zoom level such that the image fills as much
of the available space as possible (e.g., it is zoomed such that short
axis of the window is filled with the image, whether that short axis
is left-right or up-down). <P>

By default, the images that are returned are frequently but not always
centered on your search target. Clicking on these icons let you see
the whole image that is returned, whether or not it is centered on
your target. <P>

<dt><img src="img/colortable.png"> <em>Changing the color table.</em>
<dd>This icon enables you to change the color table of the
displayed image. When you click the button, a pull-down menu appears
with a wide variety of color table choices. Select your new color
table from the options shown:<br>
<img src="img/colortableoptions.png"><P>

<dt><img src="img/stretch.png"> <em>Changing the color table
stretch.</em> 
<dd>This icon enables you to change the color stretch of the displayed
image. For much more information, please <a href="#stretches">see
below</A>.<P>

<A NAME="rotateImage"><!-- --></A>
<dt><img src="img/rotate.png"> <em>Rotating the image to any
angle </em> 
<dd>This feature allows you to rotate the image about the displayed
center of your image to any angle of your choice, in degrees.  It will
rotate the image counter-clockwise (to the left) East of North if the
image has a WCS embedded in it. <br><img
src="img/rotatepopup.png"><br> You can type a number in the "angle"
box, or use the slider, to rotate the image. To bring it back to
North-up, click on the "North up" icon in the pop-up or in the main
image toolbar.  To exit the pop-up without making further changes, hit
the 'x' in the upper right of the pop-up.<P>

<dt><img src="img/northup.png"> <em>Rotating the image so that North is
up</em>.  
<dd>Images retrieved from Finder Chart are commonly already oriented
such that North is up, or close to it. However, when interactively
investigating images, or in certain situations, you could find
yourself in a situation where North is not necessarily up. Clicking
this icon will orient the selected image so that North is up.  <P>

<dt><img src="img/flip.png"> <em>Flipping the image on the y-axis</em>.  
<dd>Clicking on this icon flips the image on the y-axis.<P>

<dt><img src="img/recenter.png"> <em>Re-center the image.
</em>
<dd> Clicking this icon produces a pull-down menu:<br>
<img src="img/recenterpulldown.png"><br>
By default, the images are aligned with your target in the center.
Other choices are to center the image in the window, or center on a
position of your choice. For the last of those, you can simply center
on that target, or center and leave a marker on the image at that
location.<P>



<dt><img src="img/selectregion.png"> <em>Selecting a region.</em>
<dd>When you click this icon, you are right away given a choice of a
rectangular selection or an elliptical selection. After you make that
choice, at first, nothing seems to happen. But, now you can click and
drag in the image, selecting a box or an ellipse on the image.  This
region can be resized by grabbing and dragging the corners of the box
or the pixels delineating the corners of a box around your ellipse.
You can make a new box right away by holding down the shift key and
clicking and dragging to select a new box.  When you have selected a
region of the image, additional icons appear above the image: 
<img src="img/selectoptions.png"> These icons will allow you to (from
left to right):
<UL>
<LI>crop the image to the selected region (then you can save the
cropped image via the save icon described above);
<LI>obtain statistics from the image on the region;
<LI>select the catalog sources overlaid on the image within
the region (highlights the sources in the list and plot, if there is a
catalog overlaid);
<LI>filter the overlaid catalog down to the sources within the enclosed
area (if there is a catalog overlaid);
<LI>zoom the image to fit the selected area;
<LI>recenter the images on the selected area.
</UL>
You can save the cropped image via the save icon (described
above).  The statistics option results in a pop-up that
looks something like this:<br><img src="img/imagestatistics.png"> <br>
Note that it calculates the location of the minimum and maximum
fluxes, and the aperture and flux-weighted centroids. If you put your
mouse over the row of the table in the pop-up, that location appears
as an 'x' on the image.  If you have a catalog overlaid, selecting
sources with this tool highlights them in the catalog list. You can
choose to impose a filter via this selection mechanism; the filters
icon changes above the catalog to indicate that there is a filter
applied (<img src="img/filtersapplied.png">). To clear the filters,
click on the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose
filters): <img src="img/cancelfilters.png">. There is much more on <a
href="tables.html#filters">filters</A> in the tables
section.<P>

<strong>Note that</strong>, if you have a rotated image such that
a crop would have to bisect pixels, it will show you the region that
encompasses your selection. If you crop at that point, then, it will
crop in image space (such that pixels are not bisected). See the
figure below -- in the original image, north is up. This has been
rotated 45 degrees. The selected region is in white. The yellow
dash-dot line is the crop in pixel space that encompasses the selected
region. <br> <img src="img/cropregion.png"><p>


<dt><img src="img/ruler.png"> <em>Measuring a distance.</em>
<dd>When you click this icon, at first, nothing seems to happen. 
However, you can now click and drag to draw a line on the image, and
the length of the line is displayed (in the middle of the line).   The
units for the measured distance (and the color of the overlay) can be
changed from the "layers" icon (described below). You can
calculate the difference in RA and Dec separately via the layers icon
as well; find the layer associated with the distance measurement and
tick the "offset calculation" box. When it displays the offset
calculation, it will give you the angle in degrees in one corner, and
the length of the line segment in the RA and Dec directions, in the
units you have specified. Clicking on this icon a second time removes
the distance tool. (You can also remove this layer via the layers
icon.)<P>

<dt><img src="img/marker.png"> <em>Put a marker on the image. </em>
<dd> When you click this icon, a pull-down menu appears with several
possible options:<br><img src="img/markeroptions.png"><br> The first
overlay choice (simply called 'marker') is a red circle. Initially, it
appears in the center of the images, and is meant to be moved to
wherever you first click in the image. It looks like this: <img
src="img/circlemarker.png">. The dash-dot line around it means that it
is 'active', so you can move (click and drag the marker) or resize it
(click and drag the dash-dot boundary).   You can change the color of
the marker (and change the label) via the "layers" icon (described
below). You can also remove this layer via the layers icon. There are
several additional options in the pulldown, enough that they have
their own <a href="#footprints">section below</A>.<P>

<dt><img src="img/compass.png"> <em>Show the directions of North and East
</em>
<dd> When you click this icon, arrows appear on the image showing
which direction is North and which is East. Clicking on this icon a
second time removes the compass rose.  (You can also remove this layer
via the layers icon, described below.) <P>

<dt><img src="img/coordinates.png"> <em>Add a coordinate grid.</em>
<dd>  Click on this icon to overlay a coordinate grid on the image.
Click it again to remove it. Customize the units of the grid (to,
e.g., Galactic coordinates) via the "layers" icon (described
below).<P>

<dt><img src="img/ds9icon.png"> <em>Read in a DS9 Regions file </em>
<dd> When you click this icon, you get a pop-up window from which you
can read in a DS9 regions file from your local disk. See the <a
href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html" target="_blank">DS9
website <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> for more
information on the syntax of these DS9 region files. The supported
regions are text, circle, box, polygon, line, and annulus. To make
this window go away without doing anything, click on the 'x' in the
upper right of the pop-up. <P>

<dt><img src="img/layers.png"> <em>Viewing/changing the layers on the
image.</em> 
<dd>If you've been following along by trying these various options,
you now have an image with a lot of annotations on it. The number that
appears in blue over the layers icon tells you at any given time how
many layers you have on the currently selected image (the image
outlined in orange). If you click this layers icon, you will get a
pop-up window with a list of all the layers you have on top of the
selected image. From the pop-up, you can turn layers off and on, at
minimum, but you can often also change exactly what is displayed and
what colors/symbols get used for it. Note that when you load 2MASS
images, image artifacts are automatically loaded but not displayed;
they  can be overlaid the the layers pop-up as well.. To add new
things, though, you need to go to other options within the toolbar.
Here is an example of a well-populated layers pop-up. <br><img
src="img/layerspopup.png"><br>
Note the target description:<img src="img/targetrowofpopup.png">
This reminds you
of the target on which you searched and what image you are working
with (here, WISE-4). The two icons
next in that row indicate, respectively, "copy this location to the
clipboard" and "center image on this position."<P>

Where it's possible to change colors of a layer, click on the 'colors'
link to be taken to a new pop-up from which you can select a new
color. For catalogs or the search target, you can also select the
symbol shape and size:<br> <img src="img/symbolpicker.png"><br> To
adjust the size, type in the symbol size in pixels or use the up/down
arrow keys to change the size by one pixel at a time. Click OK to
implement your choices.  To delete a layer, click on "delete." Some
layers do not have that option; to remove that layer, click on the
corresponding icon from which you added that feature. Alternatively,
you can "show all" or "hide all" with the buttons on the lower left of
the pop-up window.  To make this pop-up window go away, click on the
'x' in the upper right of the pop-up. <P>

If you searched on catalogs from the front page, you may have an
intimidating number of layers right away. The interaction of the
selected image, the layers themselves, and the layers pop-up can be
very powerful but also very intimidating. This is discussed more
<a href="#catalogsandlayers">in the catalogs and layers section
below<A>.<P>

<dt><img src="img/undoall.png"><em>Restoring everything to the
defaults</em>
<dd>If you've played around a lot with the image, you may want to undo
everything you've done. Click this button to restore everything to
their original default values. Some layers may persist; remove them
via the layers icon described above. <P>


<dt><img src="img/lockedimages.png"><em>Lock/unlock image color tables
and overlays</em> 
<dd>When this is set to "lock", all the images that you have loaded
are linked together for color tables and overlays. This image lock is
turned on by default.  You can click on this icon to turn off this
linkage among the images, enabling you to change images on an
individual basis. Click it again to re-enable it. <P>

<dt><img src="img/lockimages.png"><em>Lock/unlock images</em>
<dd>When this is set to "lock", all the images that you have loaded
are linked together for zooming, scrolling, etc. This image lock is
turned on by default.  You can click on this icon to unlock it or
change how it is locked.  Clicking it produces this
pull-down menu:<br>
<img src="img/lockimagespulldown.png"><br>
The first set of options aligns the images only once; the second set
of options makes the alignment persist ("lock") when you move the
images. You can align by the images' WCS (e.g., RA and Dec), by the
target, by the pixels according to the origin of the coordinate system
in the image header, or by the pixel at the image center. The most
common choice is likely the WCS align and lock. This is discussed in
more detail in the <a href="#wcs">WCS section</A> below.
<P>



<dt><img src="img/fitsheader.png"> <em>Viewing the FITS header.</em>
<dd>This icon will display a pop-up window with the FITS header of the
background image.  If you click on the columns of the FITS header in
the pop-up, it will sort the keywords alphabetically by that column.
This is useful for finding individual keywords in particularly densely
populated FITS headers. Click the header again to sort in
reverse-alphabetical order, and a third time to return to the default
order. Below are examples of the original and sorted FITS header.  
To make this window go away,
click on the 'x' in the upper right of the pop-up, or click
"close" on the bottom.<br>
<img src="img/unsortedfitsheader.png" width="45%">
<img src="img/sortedfitsheader.png" width="45%"> <P>
Further, you can click on the gears in the upper right of the window
to bring up a dialog box via which you can filter down the header
keywords (using the same syntax as the other <a
href="catalogs.html#filters">filters</A>):<br>
<img src="img/fitsheaderoptions.png"><P>


<dt><img src="img/help.png"> <em>Getting help.</em>
<dd>  Clicking on this icon takes you to this help page.<P>

</dl>

<a name="stretches"><h3>Specific information on Color Stretches</h3></A>


<img src="img/stretch.png"> This icon enables you to change the color
stretch of the displayed image. (This option is only available for
FITS, not HiPS, images.) When you click the button, a pull-down menu
appears with a variety of choices. You can choose from a set of
pre-selected options:<br><img src="img/stretchoptions.png"><br> If you
pick the first one, "color stretch", you can customize the stretch. A
pop-up window appears with a histogram of the values in the image, and
you can change the stretch type and range. <br><img
src="img/customstretch.png"> <BR> If you pick a color stretch from the
pre-defined options, the pop-up window reflects this change. 

Example: pick 'Linear stretch to 99%'. Go back to "color stretch".
Note that it has filled out the stretch type and ranges to reflect the
current choice. Then -- either with the pop-up window still up or not
-- go back and pick a different pre-defined stretch from the standard
options. Note that the values in the pop-up change to reflect this
current choice.<P>

If you have a <a href="#3color">3-color image</A>, you can change the
stretch in each color plane separately; select the tab at the top
accordingly for red, green, or blue.  By default, it stretches each
band independently, and you can set the parameters in the stretch
pop-up accordingly.<P> <img src="img/3colorstretch.png"><P>

As described in <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2004PASP..116..133L" 
target="_blank">Lupton et al. (2004) <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, a different algorithm may be
useful for creating 3-band color images. Select "Hue preserving
stretch" to invoke this option. This stretch should be a
brightness-independent color-preserving asinh stretch, though in
practical terms, it seems to work best for optical images. <P>

<img src="img/luptonstretch.png"><P>

It may be useful to scale individual channels; sliders allow you to do
so. The Q parameter has another slider. For a linear stretch, Q=0;
increase Q to change what features are emphasized. Pedestal values can
also be set to allow the level assigned to "black" to change.<P>

<a name="footprints"><h3>Footprints</h3></A>

The marker icon (<img src="img/marker.png">) has a pull-down menu with
several possible options:<br><img src="img/markeroptions.png"><br> Any
of the options with an arrow on the right can expand to additional
subsidiary choices, e.g.,:<br> <img src="img/markeroptionsp1.png"><br>
We now describe these various footprints here.<P>


For each of these choices, the markers appear initially in the center
of the loaded images. The first mouse click you make in any of the
images will move the marker to that location.<P>

Each of these marker choices, when overlaid and/or selected as
'active', has a dot-dash square around it. If it is asymmetrical (most
of them are), it has an additional "appendage" and a red plus at the
center of the footprint:<br> <img src="img/activeregion.png"><br>
These so-called "handles" allow you to resize and/or rotate the
marker, depending on the nature of the marker. These handles only
appear when the marker is selected as active; if you wait a few
seconds, they vanish.<P>

<strong>Troubleshooting and Tips:</strong> 
<UL>
<LI>Some of these footprints are <em>large</em>. If you have a small
image, some of these footprints will be larger than your image. Zoom
out to see it, or find a larger image to use. If you overlay, say, a
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (WFIRST) footprint on a 2MASS image,
you may need to zoom out a considerable amount before you can see the
Roman footprint. You will see the center indicator of the marker
before you will see the Roman footprint itself. 
<LI>You can add multiple copies of the same marker using the layers
pop-up (described generally above).  From the layers pop-up, there is
a link right under the 'angle' option that says "Add [marker type]" --
click on that to get an additional marker of the same type. You can
also add a label to the marker from the layers pop-up, or change its
color.
<LI>If you have many footprints on the same image, you may have
trouble grabbing and moving footprints lower in the stack of layers on
the image. For example, overlay footprint 1, then footprint 2, and you
might have a hard time grabbing and rotating footprint 1 after
footprint 2 has been added. The only workaround here is to use the
layers pop-up (described generally above) to hide footprint 2, then
move footprint 1, then restore footprint 2.
<LI>If you have images of very different resolutions loaded
(e.g., IRAS and really anything else), sometimes it struggles to
render the marker on each image. You may need to place markers on one
image at a time. (Unclick the "lock overlays" button to place markers
one image at a time.)
</UL>



<img src="img/circlemarker.png"> The first overlay choice (simply
called 'marker') is a red circle.   <P>

The remaining markers are all footprints from various telescopes:
Spitzer, SOFIA, HST, JWST, and Roman. HST, JWST and Roman are derived
from information provided via MAST (see <a
href="http://gsss.stsci.edu/webservices/footprints/help.html"
target="_blank">http://gsss.stsci.edu/webservices/footprints/help.html
<img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.) For JWST and Roman in
particular, they are pre-launch values.<P>

<img src="img/iracfoot.png"> <strong>Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 micron
footprints.</strong> These two footprints are placed separately
from each other. The footprint can be moved or rotated. Click and drag
the center of the footprint. A circle appears with four small circles
("handles") around it. Grab and drag the small circles to rotate it,
or drag the big circle to move it. Change the color, delete, or add
more copies of the IRAC footprints from the layers pop-up.<P>

<a name="3color"><h3>3-color images</h3></A>

In Finder Chart, a default search results in images in many bands of
the same region of the sky. It can be useful to create 3-color images
from these multi-color bands.<P>

The images window pane consists of rows of images grouped by survey. 
Near the top left of the images window pane, you can find this icon:
<img src="img/3colorimg.png">. If you click on this icon, at the end
of each row, a 3-color image appears that has been created out of the
bands going into that survey. Here is an example for HL Tau:
<br><img src="img/hltau.png" width="100%"><br>
At the end of each set of survey images is a new, 3-color image. This
image has been automatically generated with pre-selected bands as the
color planes: 
<table border="2">
<tr><th>survey</th><th>red</th><th>green</th><th>blue</th></tr>
<tr><td>DSS</td><td>DSS 2 IR</td><td>DSS 2 red</td><td>DSS 2 Blue</td></tr>
<tr><td>SDSS</td><td>z</td><td>r</td><td>u</td></tr>
<tr><td>2MASS</td><td>K</td><td>H</td><td>J</td></tr>
<tr><td>WISE</td><td>W3</td><td>W2</td><td>W1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Spitzer/SEIP</td><td>I3</td><td>I2</td><td>I1</td></tr>
<tr><td>AKARI</td><td>WideL (140 um)</td><td>WideS (90 um)</td><td>n60 (65 um)</td></tr>
<tr><td>IRAS</td><td>IRAS-60</td><td>IRAS-25</td><td>IRAS-12</td></tr>
</table>
<P>

The "3-color" button is "sticky" in that if you turn it on, and then
do another search, the new search will automatically make 3-color
images.<P>


<!-- Once you have turned on these 3-color images, select one of these
3-color images by clicking on it. Then, a new icon appears on the left
of the image toolbox: <img src="img/new3colorimg.png">. If you click
on this icon, this window appears: <p><img
src="img/changecolorplanes.png" width="100%"><p> From this window, you can change
which color planes are used in this 3-color image. You can select one
of the images that has already been loaded, or you can change one of
the color planes to be a new image from another survey that you may or
may not have already loaded (it pre-fills the target to match your
current target) or from your disk. Click 'Load' in the lower right to
actually implement your changes. Click 'Close' in the upper left to
return to your prior view without making any changes. <P> -->

To save the color PNGs, you can do either of the following:
(1) Click on the image to select it (make it outlined in orange).
Click on the diskette icon in the far left of the image toolbar.
Select "png" for the file type to save, and click 'download.' 
(2) Click on the "download" button in the far upper left of the images
window pane. Click on "include color images" in the download options
pop-up and save as PNGs. <P>


<A NAME="catalogsandlayers"><H3>Catalogs and Layers</H3></A>

If you search on catalogs from the search results page, then Finder
Chart will overlay these catalogs on your images as additional layers.
In order to see the layers on any given image, you need to click on
the layers icon (<img src="img/layers.png">) in the image toolbox
(described above). See both the <a href="tables.html">Tables
section</A> and <a href="catalogs.html">the Catalogs section</A> for
much more information on tables and catalogs in general.  <P>

However, if you search on catalogs from the main search page,
Finder Chart overlays the catalogs on your images right away, and it
does so in a way that is quite powerful, but may be initially
confusing. Critical to understanding what it is doing (and how you can
change it) is the concept of the "selected image."  Out of the
potentially large number of images you have loaded, one is "selected"
-- it is outlined in orange. Click on a different image, and that
image becomes outlined in orange as the selected image. Different
things are overlaid on different images (or image sets), so it is
important to realize which image you have selected. <P>

In order to explain what it is doing, let's look at a real example. 
Search on "HL Tau" and ask it to retrieve catalogs within the image
boundary: <br><img src="img/hltausearch.png" width="100%"><p> 

Here are the results obtained after a few seconds: <br><img
src="img/hltauresults.png" width="100%"><br>  <P>

This is a single target search, so three panes are returned; one has
the images (top), and the bottom has two panes, one with the catalogs
and the other with the plots from the catalogs. The images have
catalogs overlaid -- the DSS doesn't have a corresponding survey, so
it has no catalog, but the SDSS images have the SDSS catalog overlaid,
the 2MASS images have the 2MASS catalog overlaid, etc. for all the
other surveys with catalogs. By selecting the 2MASS catalog tab on the
bottom, and then selecting a row in the 2MASS catalog, that object is
highlighted in the 2MASS image and the 2MASS catalog plot. It works the
other way as well - select an object in the SDSS image or plot, and
the object is highlighted in the 2MASS catalog. This behavior is
identical to that for <a href="catalogs.html">catalogs in
general</A>.<P>

What is potentially confusing here is that the catalogs arrive with
the search results and are already read in. From the main search page,
you could conceivably stumble into having (1) nothing overlaid; (2)
only the central source overlaid, so it looks like nothing is
overlaid; (3) so many sources overlaid that you can't see the image. 
From the layers pop-up, you can control which of these loaded catalogs
are shown on the selected image (and in which colors, and what symbol
shape).  But what is shown on what image is a strong function of which
image you have selected.<P> 

Perhaps you are interested in whether the WISE catalog has
counterparts to an object seen in the 2MASS images. Here is how you
add the WISE catalog to the 2MASS images.
<OL>
<LI>Select one of the 2MASS images by clicking on it -- it should be
outlined in orange. For this example, click on the J band image.
<LI>Select the 'layers' icon from the image toolbox:
<br><img
src="img/hltaulayers.png" width="100%"><br> 
<LI>The layers pop-up shows all of the potential layers you can add to this
particular image from things already read in. You can also add those
layers to <strong>the entire row</strong> of 2MASS images. Right now,
in the screen shot above, the 2MASS image has the query object shown,
and the 2MASS catalog shown on the entire row of 2MASS images. 
<LI>To add the WISE catalog to just the J band image (selected in the
screen shot above), locate the WISE catalog row in the layers pop-up,
and select the radio button for "Overlay: image". Then click on the
checkbox for "Show: WISE".
<LI>The WISE catalog appears on just the J band image, in the color
and with the symbol shape as indicated in the layers pop-up.
</OL>

Using a similar approach, you can add the 2MASS catalog to all images,
or just the IRAS catalog to just the WISE-4 image, or just the row of
WISE images, etc. <P>

From the main search page, you can choose to search the catalogs just
over a small radius, and/or further constrain it to just find the
closest source (one-to-one match) to your target. If you do this, the
overlays of the catalogs will (most likely) all be right on top of the
same, single source, and it will be much less clear that the catalogs
are overlaid at all, much less that the catalogs are different on each
set of images. But, it is behaving in the same way as what is
described here!<P>

<strong>Helpful tip:</strong> If you leave the layers pop-up window
open while you click on different images to select them, you can see the
contents of the pop-up layers window change to reflect the layers (and
options) present in that selected image. <P>


<A NAME="breakingout"><H3>Breaking out of the pane (and going back)</H3></A>

By default in Finder Chart, the screen is broken up into 1-4 panes.
The set of images corresponding to the target could be your only pane.
If you searched on a list of targets, the list is on the left. If you
searched on catalogs, the catalogs and plots are on the bottom.  For
some purposes, it is useful to view the images (or the tables) as
large as possible. On the upper right of any pane,  there is an expand
icon <img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. Clicking on it will expand
these tables into a larger window, taking up as much space in your
browser window as possible. On the upper right of the image pane,
there is this icon: <img src="img/expandimagetiles.png">, which
expands the window pane into a larger window, taking up as much space
in your browser window as possible, but still leaving the images in
tiled view.  <P>

There is a set of options just above the images, even when the images
pane is smaller (and the catalogs/plots/other targets are visible):<br>
<img src="img/expview.png"><br>
The large "Close" arrow at the upper left is always available in the
expanded views, and enables you to return back
to the pane view.<P> 

The "Prepare Download" button packages up your data so you can <a
href="downloads.html">download it</A>.<P>

There is a cluster of icons <img src="img/imagetiles.png"> that
portray (in icon form) the different views you can have of the images
you have loaded. The first icon (the big square) denotes "show one
image at a time." The second icon (the cluster of four squares)
denotes "show smaller images of all the images I have loaded, but
still take up the whole browser window with the set" (as opposed to
going back to the window panes).  <P>

<img src="img/expview2.png"><br> If you are viewing one image at a
time,  the arrows allow you to click through  your set of images in
the order they are loaded. <P>

<img src="img/expview3.png"><br> These next two icons will generate a
PDF and turn on the <a href="#3color">3-color images</A>,
respectively.<P>



<A NAME="wcs"><h3>World Coordinate System (WCS) Alignment and Related
Features</h3></A>

As described above, there are two different lock buttons on the image
toolbar, one (<img src="img/lockedimages.png">) for the color
table/stretch/overlays, and another, different one (<img
src="img/lockimages.png">) for WCS matching. This section describes
the image locking in more detail.<P>

The main purpose of having lock buttons at all is to make it easier to
change color tables for everything at once, or to zoom/scroll all the
images at once. <P>

To use either of the locking buttons: Select an image by clicking on
it; note that your selected image is outlined in orange. Lock by color
and then change the color table in that selected image; all the images
change color tables. Lock by position and all the images align
to the same scale as your selected image.<P>

Aligning images by position on the sky is likely to be the most common
use of locking.  You can align FITS and HiPS images to each other.
When you have locked the images, if you zoom, click-and-drag, etc.,
then all the images move together. This option only makes sense if all
of your loaded images are of the same region of sky, which they are
when using Finder Chart. (In other IRSA tools, it's quite possible to
have images loaded from many different targets.) There may be
situations where you likely you don't want all of the displayed bands
to change together, which is why locking by position of any sort is an
option distinct from locking color tables.<P>

When aligning images, you can specify how the images align and for
how long. Clicking the lock images icon produces this pull-down
menu:<br> <img src="img/lockimagespulldown.png"><P>

The first set of options aligns the images only once; the second set
of options makes the alignment persist ("lock") when you move the
images. <P>

You can align by the images' WCS (world coordinate system,
e.g., RA and Dec), by the target (align by target on the screen,
regardless of position in the sky), by the pixels according to the
origin of the coordinate system in the image header, or by the pixel
at the image center. The most common choice is likely the WCS align
and lock.<P>

Here are examples of different alignments, left to right: align by
WCS, by pixel origin, and by pixel at image centers.<br>
<img src="img/alignbywcs.png" width="30%">
<img src="img/alignbypxorigin.png" width="30%">
<img src="img/alignbyimgcenter.png" width="30%">
<P>
Note that aligning by WCS puts North up, and aligned so that each
image has the same angular scale. <P>
In contrast, here is an align by target - several different spiral
galaxies, but the target used for each image is in the center of each
image tile.<br>
<img src="img/alignbytarget.png" width="30%"><P>

To remove an image (or catalog) entirely, click on the small 'x'
in the upper right of the image in the tiled view, or on the small
'x' in the corner of the image (or catalog) tab in the window
pane view.<P>
