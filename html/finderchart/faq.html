<h2>Finder Chart: FAQs</h2>

<DL>


<dt>Do you have any tutorial videos? 
<dd>Yes. The <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> has several tutorials that are relevant to the Finder
Chart service -- see the Finder Chart playlist as well as the set of
"micro-tutorials" relevant for more than one archive. The videos are
in HD; you may need to manually use the YouTube gear menu to force it
to realize this. There is also English Closed-Captioning available.<P>

<DT>I have a bunch of targets and I want to get all the images for
these targets. Can I do this?
<dd>You can give it a <a href="basics.html#byTable">list of
sources</A>, up to 1000 sources, and it will go away and think about
it and load them all into the browser. You can customize the stretch,
color table, etc. You can then ask it to <a
href="downloads.html">prepare the download</A> for you, and when it's
done, if you want, mail you a list of URLs to download the data.<P>

<dt>Is there a way to interact with Finder Chart from the command line
or a script?
<dd>
Yes. There are three approaches that might meet your needs.
<OL>
<LI>You can give it a <a href="basics.html#byTable">list of
sources</A>, up to 1000 sources, and it will go away and think about
it and load them all into the browser. You can then ask it to <a
href="downloads.html">prepare the download</A> and when it's done, if
you want, mail you a list of URLs to download the data.
<LI>You can construct a URL that, when loaded, results in the
interactive web-based user interface, with files pre-loaded.
<LI>You can use the <a href="api.html">application programming
interface (API)</A> to obtain the files you want.
</OL><P>

<dt>How come some of the 2MASS images are not "whole images", like
it's trying to center on my target but half the image is missing as if
it's going off the edge of an image?
<dd>It is actually running off the edges of the relatively small
images we have in the 2MASS image archive. We are working on getting
larger images such that this 'edge effect' will happen less often and for
fewer targets. <P>

<dt>I've retrieved a catalog. What are all these columns?
<dd>
The columns that are returned are exactly those that are stored in the
archive for that catalog. Each catalog is different. Please check the
project's documentation for each catalog separately, all of which are
available at IRSA. Some of the more
commonly used ones are:

</UL>
<P>

<dt>I've created a nice image within the FITS viewer, and I have the
stretch and overlays exactly the way that I want them. How do I save
this?
<dd>Click on the diskette icon and tell it to save the PNG file. If
you just save the FITS file, you will lose the overlays, and if you
just save the overlays (as a ds9 region file), you will lose the
underlying image.<P>

<dt>What do I do with the zip files I get when I download data?
<dd>To uncompress the files you have downloaded, type "unzip
foo.zip". To uncompress multiple files at once, type "unzip '*.zip'"
(the single quotes are important), or "unzip \*.zip" -- you just have
to escape out the wildcard.<P>

<dt>How do I get more help?
<dd>
The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help, as does
"Finder Chart Help" from under the "Help" in the IRSA menu on the
top of the Finder Chart page. You can also download a PDF version of
this manual; look at the top of the help window.<P>

the command-C did not work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the
right mouse button did.)<P>
