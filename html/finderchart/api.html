<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</A></h3>

There are two ways to interact with Finder Chart in an automatic or
semi-automatic fashion.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><strong>Batch searching</strong>
<DD>You can pass a list of up to 1000 sources to Finder Chart from the
search screen, and then bundle up the results to download all at once
in any of a variety of formats. More information on that is in the <a
href="basics.html#byTable">Basics of Searching</A> section. This
option is best if you don't want to write code to search and parse the
results, and/or if you have at most a few thousand sources.<P>

<DT><strong>API, or application programming interface</strong>
<DD>An API, or application programming interface, enables programs to
interact with the SHA, search for data, and download it. You can write
a program that will construct a series of URLs and query our server,
resulting in XML files. Then you will need to write code to parse
those XML files to obtain the links that you need to download the the
data files meeting your search criteria. Much of the rest of this
section describes the input and output parameters (with examples) for
this API interface. <strong>Please note</strong>
that it is really easy to inadvertently launch a 'denial-of-service'
attack on IRSA's servers if you are not careful. Use this option with
caution. This option is best if you are pulling images for many
thousands of sources automatically. Most of the rest of this chapter
covers the API.<P>
</dl>

There used to be another way to interact with Finder Chart -- via URL
construction. This old way no longer works. There is a new way to
interact with the API to launch a FinderChart session; see later in
this section.
</dl>

<h3><a name="introapi">API: Introduction</A></h3>

The Finder Chart service can be accessed via an HTTP/GET program
interface (basically a really long URL) where the request is a set of
<i>parameter=value</i> pairs, separated by ampersands (&amp;). 
What is returned is an XML file containing metadata and URL links to
download products with the related ancillary files. Below, we
describe these input parameters and the columns returned.<P>

Many of the interactive features inherent in the web interface, e.g., the
visualization tools, are not available via the API.<P>

The <strong>base URL</strong> for this service is
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?parameter=value&amp;parameter=value...<P>

The <strong>input parameters</strong> are specified by standard
parameter/value pairs. For example, "locstr=m101" specifies the search center of
the subset images. A URL that just specifies this location and
nothing else looks like
https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?locstring=m101
This query does not specify either the sizes of the
images or the survey names, so the default values of all the rest of
the parameters are used. <P>

One command to execute this basic query with those most simple input
parameters is:
<pre>
wget --output-document=out.xml "https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?locstr=m101"
</pre>
Things to notice: It is https, not http. The URL is enclosed within
quotes. The output is saved in out.xml, but if you have errors in your
query, the file out.xml may not actually be xml but instead be html.
It is the simplest query, only specifying a target, and the rest the
parameters fall back to the defaults. You can use curl instead of
wget; see below.
<P>

The <strong>output</strong> (saved in out.xml in the command above) is
an XML document containing the URL of the corresponding interactive
Finder Chart search results, and the URLs that point to the individual
retrieved FITS images and the corresponding PNG images (both small and
large). <P>

Because the API queries result in XML tables, if you click
on any of the example API links below, your browser may have
trouble rendering it, or will render only bits and pieces of the
embedded text.  You may need to save the contents of the link to a
file in order to read what is returned. You may be able to use
"View Source" to see the result in more legible format.<P>

Note that when you parse the XML file, you will be looking for URLs.
To retrieve a URL using wget or curl, you should enclose the URL in
quotes. Here are some examples: 
<pre>
wget --output-document=file.pdf "https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?mode=getImage&file_type=pdf&subsetsize=5&survey=DSS,SDSS,2MASS,IRIS,WISE&locstr=291.468658447+40.343852997"
curl --output file.pdf "https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?mode=getImage&file_type=pdf&subsetsize=5&survey=DSS,SDSS,2MASS,IRIS,WISE&locstr=291.468658447+40.343852997"
wget --output-document=file.xml "https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?subsetsize=15&survey=2MASS,AKARI,WISE,SEIP&locstr=247.025+-24.541667"
curl --output file.xml "https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?subsetsize=15&survey=DSS,SDSS,2MASS,AKARI,WISE,SEIP&locstr=247.025+-24.541667"
</pre><P>

<strong>Please note</strong> that it is really easy to inadvertently
launch something that is functionally equivalent to a '<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"
target="_blank">denial-of-service <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>' attack on IRSA's servers if you are not careful.
Please be sure to test your code using only a subset of your desired
requests, and add throttle control to your code, e.g., add some 'wait'
steps between successive requests. If we notice an undue load on our
servers (a real life example is more than 70,000 requests over 10
hours, or an average of 2 per second over 10 hrs), we may block your
IP address, so if your requests suddenly stop working, this may be
why. Please contact the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> in this case. 


<h3><a name="inputparameters">API Input Parameters</A></h3>

The input parameters are entered as standard HTTP "parameter=value"
pairs in HTTP/GET syntax. In this syntax, the parameter name is
followed by an equals sign which is then followed by a value. These
pairs are separated from each other by ampersand (&amp;) characters.
No extra spaces are allowed, and if the value needs to contain any
spaces or special characters that might cause ambiguities, these
spaces have to be encoded as shown in any URL reference. In
the rest of this section, we list the parameters. For examples, see
later sections below. <P>

Note that if you want to download PNG files via the API, there is
currently no way to change the default stretch via the API.
<!-- (There wasn't any way to do this in the old Finder Chart either.) If
you need a different default stretch, instead of using the API, break
up your targets into lists of 1000 or less, and <a
href="basics.html#byTable">do a batch search</A>. When the search
returns, customize the stretch for the first object in your list, and
then ask it to <a href="downloads.html">prepare the download</A>,
selecting PNGs as the download option, and the stretch (and other
parameters) you have established for the first one in the list are
propagated to all of the objects in the list. !--><P>

The following table has the one required parameter (locstr) first, and
then the rest of the parameters in alphabetical order.

<table border="2">
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Values</th><th>Default</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>locstr <br><strong>(REQUIRED)</strong></td><td> 
This input field must contain either a sky coordinate or an object
name resolvable via NED or SIMBAD. If the input field contains a
string which can be interpreted as a coordinate representation, it is
used as such. Both decimal degree and sexagesimal notations are
supported. Spaces, etc. should be encooded
</td><td>no default</td><td>
The "locstr" is the only required parameter; if it is an object
name, it is resolved into coordinates using NED and, if that fails,
SIMBAD. Any spaces or minus signs or other special characters must be 
encoded (see, e.g., <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP"
target="_blank">this site <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A> for more information).
The following are examples of acceptable name/coordinate formats
(human-readable version in parentheses):

</td></tr>


<tr><td>file_type <br><em>must be used in conjunction with "mode"</em></td><td>fits, pdf,
png </td><td>fits</td><td>Specifies the desired output of a specific
query. FITS, PDF, and PNG are the same options as when you select "Download" in the
interactive GUI.  The PDF option results in the PDF downloading; the
rest are zip files of a subdirectory with the contents being the
selected option (the FITS files or the PNG files). Note that
 this does not work for mode=getResult.</td></tr>

<tr><td>grid</td><td>true or false</td><td>false</td><td>Specifies
whether or not a grid should be added to the PNG
images. Note that
 this does not work for mode=getResult.</td></tr>

<tr><td>marker</td><td>true or false</td><td>false</td><td>Specifies
whether or not a location marker should be added to the PNG
images. Note that
 this does not work for mode=getResult.</td></tr>

<tr><td>marker_color</td><td>Basic color names in lowercase or HEX value</td><td>red</td><td>
Specifies the color of the marker.  'marker' option must be set to true.  Color name may be
one of black, aqua, blue, cyan, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, magenta, maroon, navy, olive,
 orange, pink, purple, red, silver, teal, white, or yellow. Note that
 this does not work for mode=getResult.</td></tr>

<tr><td>marker_size</td><td>integer</td><td>4</td><td>Specifies the
size of the circle marker, in px. 'marker' option must be set to true.  Size
must be greater than 0.  The overlay symbol is a circle whose diameter is 2 times the
marker_size in px. Note that
 this does not work for mode=getResult.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>mode</td><td>prog, getImage, getResult</td><td>prog</td><td>Specifies the format of
the returned file; "prog" (default) yields the XML format, and "getImage"
retrieves the file given by the "file_type" parameter. Another option,
"getResult", can be used in the URL to spawn a Finder Chart session with the 
results in the browser.  </td></tr>

<!-- <tr><td>orientation</td><td>right or
left</td><td>left</td><td>Specifies whether to point the East axis to
the left as specified in the FITS image or to flip the image so that
East points to right while generating PNG images. North is up in all
cases.</td></tr> -->

<!-- <tr><td>page_layout</td><td>OnePerTarget or OnePerSurvey</td><td>OnePerTarget</td>
<td>OnePerTarget - lays out all of the images on one page.  OnePerSurvey
splits the images into multiple pages by survey. This option only
makes sense in the context of PDF output.</td></tr> -->

<!-- <<tr><td>reproject</td><td>true or
false</td><td>false</td><td>Specifies whether to reproject and
resample the images from different bands of a dataset to a uniform
resolution while generating the PNG images. When this is chosen,
these resampled images can be used to make color images. However, this
option takes longer to run (about 3 minutes per image). 
</td></tr> -->

<tr><td>subsetsize</td><td>a decimal
number</td><td>5</td><td>Specifies the cutout size of the retrieved
images in arcmin. It should be between 0.1 and 60.0 arcmin.  
</td></tr>

<tr><td>survey</td><td> DSS, SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, SEIP, AKARI, IRAS</td>
<td>DSS, SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, IRAS</td><td> Specifies the survey dataset
to be retrieved. ("IRIS" can be used instead of "IRAS" for the same
image set.) It can be specified parameter pair "survey=value" (e.g.
"survey=SDSS"). To specify multiple datasets, simply add more to the
query (e.g., "survey=SDSS,DSS,SEIP"). When unspecified, it defaults to
retrieving the original five datasets. 
</td></tr>

<h3><a name="inputexamples">API Input Examples</A></h3>

The following examples can be run by clicking their links; examples 1
through 8 produce valid results while 9 and 10 are examples of the
error conditions. Number 11 is the updated version of URL
construction. All of them should have this prepended:

<h3><a name="outputparameters">API Output Parameters (in XML)</A></h3>

When you run a web application interactively, often the return is HTML
text which is rendered in a browser and contains links to download
additional data files. However, HTML is notoriously difficult to
parse. So, in program mode, we instead return by default a simple XML
document. This document can be rendered in a browser, but the normal
use pattern is as follows: have your program make an HTTP request
using the above parameters; retrieve the XML result into a file (or
memory); have your program parse it; extract links to the desired
final data files; and use these links (again from your program, using,
e.g., wget) to retrieve the data.<P>

The interaction above can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from
simple scripting (using programs like 'wget') to integrated URL-access
and XML-parsing in JAVA, PERL, Python, etc. Our XML is simple enough
that if you do not have XML-parsing tools, simple pattern checking
(manually built code or tools like PERL) should suffice.<P>

The returned XML "inventory" contains a results HTML page which
includes the rotated and scaled PNG images from the retrieved images
so they are all same size and orientation for being useful as a Finder
Chart. In addition, it contains the URLs of the retrieved FITS images,
the scaled PNG images used in the HTML page, and the PNG images in
the original size. It also contains the 2MASS glint and persistent
artifacts tables if the 2MASS survey is queried.<P>


Here are all of the XML tag names that can occur. Examples of returned
queries are below.<P>

<table border="2">
<tr><th>Tag name</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>finderchart</td><td>The top tag of the XML file which contains
a variable "status" indicating whether the query is successful; "ok"
for successul query and "error" otherwise.</td></tr>

<tr><td>message</td><td>The error message when the query status is
"error".</td></tr>

<tr><td>input</td><td>A section tag which contains several input
parameter sub-tags.</td></tr>

<tr><td>locstr</td><td>Input objname or coordinate (examples
above).</td></tr>

<!-- <tr><td>orientation</td><td>The orientaion of the PNG images as
either "left" or "right", as explained above.</td></tr> -->

<!-- <tr><td>reproject</td><td>A "true" or "false" value.</td></tr> -->

<tr><td>grid</td><td>A "true" or "false".</td></tr>

<tr><td>marker</td><td>A "true" or "false". </td></tr>

<tr><td>result</td><td>A section tag which contains sub-tags of all
the results including the search coordinate (in equatorial, galactic,
and ecliptic), the URL links to the retrieved FITS
images, the PNG images, and the 2MASS glint and persistent artifact
tables when the 2MASS survey is requested.</td></tr>

<tr><td>datatag</td><td>The datatag contains the parameters of the
query which allows the same query to be reproduced at a later time.
Please consult the datatag instruction document on how to rerun the
query.</td></tr>

<tr><td>equCoord</td><td>The input location in the equatorial
coordinate system and sexigesimal format.</td></tr>

<tr><td>galCoord</td><td>The input location in the galactic coordinate
system.</td></tr>

<tr><td>eclCoord</td><td>The input location in the ecliptic coordinate
system.</td></tr>

<tr><td>totalimages</td><td>The total number of images retrieved.</td></tr>

<tr><td>htmlfile</td><td>The URL of the HTML file that contains the
finder chart results. </td></tr> 

<tr><td>pdffile</td><td>The URL of the PDF file that contains the
finder chart results. </td></tr>

<tr><td>image</td><td>This is a sub-tag of the "result" tag, but it is
a section tag that contains the sub-tags of an image's information and
URLs. </td></tr>

<tr><td>colorimage</td><td>This is a sub-tag of the "result"
tag.</td></tr>

<tr><td>surveyname</td><td>The survey name of the retrieved image:
SDSS, DSS, 2MASS, WISE, SEIP, AKARI, or IRAS.  ("IRIS" can be used
instead of "IRAS" for the same image set.)</td></tr>

<tr><td>band</td><td>The band name of the retrieved image. By default,
all bands are returned.</td></tr>

<tr><td>obsdate</td><td>The observation date extracted from the
retrieved FITS image.</td></tr>

<tr><td>fitsurl</td><td>The URL of the retrieved FITS image.</td></tr>

<tr><td>jpgurl</td><td>The URL of the PNG image which is the same
resolution as the FITS image. (Note that the name of the tag incldues
'jpg' but it returns PNGs.) </td></tr>

<tr><td>shrunkjpgurl</td><td>The URL of the shrunken PNG image.  (Note
that the name of the tag includes 'jpg' but it returns PNGs.) </td></tr>

<tr><td>artifact</td><td>The sub-tag of the result, one for each
survey.</td></tr>

<tr><td>arturl</td><td>The URL to get the artifacts for the
survey.</td></tr> 

</table><P>

Once you have parsed the URLs out of the XML, you can retrieve the
results using wget or curl. In order to do this, you should enclose
the URL in quotes, and tell it what to do with the output. Here are
some explicit examples of using quotes around URLs for wget or curl: 
<pre>

retrieved results. Output that is XML (examples 1-10 above) may throw
your browser a curve ball. Choose "View Source" within your browser to
see everything that is returned. Output that is a zip file or pdf file
(example 11) should be easily handled by your browser; as noted above,
when using wget or curl, you should specify how it should save the
results. <P>

The simplest returned XML is an error message. Here is a screen shot
of the source XML returned from example 9 above: 
<blockquote><table border="1"><tr><td><br><img
src="img/xmlerror.png"><br><P></td></tr></table></blockquote>

Example 6 is rendered in my browser (at least to start) as:
<blockquote><table border="1"><tr><td><br><img src="img/example6output1.png" width="100%"><br></td></tr></table></blockquote>
with additional image tags (not shown) for the other images
returned.<P>

As can be seen, the tags here reflect the tags listed in the Output
Parameters above, and they change to reflect the query results
accordingly.<P>





<h3><a name="urlconstruction">URL Construction</A></h3>

It used to be that you could construct a very long URL consisting largely of
"parameter=value" pairs and launch an interactive browser Finder Chart
session with images pre-loaded according to your parameters. <P>

Now, you can use the API to generate a URL to start a session.  For
example, clicking on this URL should launch a new browser window with
images loaded that are centered on M101: <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?mode=getResult&amp;locstr=m101"
target="_blank">https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/finderchart/servlet/api?mode=getResult&amp;locstr=m101</A><P>

Note that the syntax is different than it has been before. Future
development of this capability will use the API (e.g., the
"mode=getResult"), not just URL construction.<P>
