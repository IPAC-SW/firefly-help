<h2>Finder Chart: Overview</h2>

Finder Chart is a searching and visualization tool that allows
cross-comparison of images from various surveys of different
wavelengths and different epochs. Data can be downloaded in any of a
variety of formats, either singly or in bulk. Catalogs from any of a
variety of sources are also available.<P>

This tool provids access to data sets from the Two Micron All Sky
Survey (2MASS), the Wide-field Infrared Explorer (WISE) AllWISE
all-sky survey, the InfraRed Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) all-sky
survey,  AKARI Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS), the Digitized Sky Surveys
(DSS) (both First and Second Generation), and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS).   <P>

Note that there are also Finder Chart video tutorials, available at
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>. Look for the playlist collecting all the Finder
Chart videos in one place.<P>

Please note that the DSS and SDSS data do not reside at IRSA, so the
successful retrieval of DSS and SDSS data depends on the operation of
the DSS and SDSS services, located at other institutions.<P>

This service makes use of components of Montage, funded by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Science
Technology Office, Computational Technologies Project, under
Cooperative Agreement Number NCC5-626 between NASA and the California
Institute of Technology. <P>

<h3><a name="surveys">Surveys, Wavelengths, and Sky Coverage</A></h3>

<h4>DSS</h4>

The Digitized Sky Survey (DSS) is a digitization of the photographic
sky survey plates from the Palomar and UK Schmidt telescopes. DSS
images have pixels between 1 and 1.7 arcsec and use three broad-band
filters covering roughly 3950 Angstroms to 9000 Angstroms.   None of
the underlying datasets are all-sky; the DSS "surveys" are actually
composites of multiple image sets taken at different times using
different instruments. The date for the specific retrieved image
appears with the image in Finder Chart. For more detailed information
on filters, dates, and coverage, see <a
href="http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/faq.html" target="_blank">the DSS
webpage at STScI <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

<tr><td>DSS2IR</td><td>I</td><td>6950 - 9000 Angstroms</td></tr>
</table><P>

<h4>SDSS</h4>

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is not an all-sky survey, but
covers more than a quarter of the sky in five optical filters, at
about 1.5 arcsecond resolution. The date that the image was obtained
is included in Finder Chart. For more detailed information on
filters, dates, and coverage, see <a href="http://www.sdss.org/"
target="_blank">the SDSS webpage <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

<tr><td>z</td><td>9060 Angstroms</td></tr>
</table><P>



<h4>2MASS</h4>

The Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) is an all-sky survey. 2MASS
images have about 1 arcsecond resolution and were obtained in three
broadband filters: J, H, and K_s (K-short). The date that the image
was obtained is included in Finder Chart. For more detailed
information about filters, dates, and coverage, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/2mass.html"
target="_blank">the 2MASS web page at IRSA <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> (and references linked

<tr><td>H</td><td>1.662 microns</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ks</td><td>2.159 microns</td></tr>
</table><P>


<h4>WISE</h4>

Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a spacecraft that
conducted an all-sky survey. WISE mapped the sky in four bands (3.4,
4.6, 12, and 22 microns) with an angular resolution of about 6.1, 6.4,
6.5, and 12.0 arcseconds in the four bands, respectively.  For more
detailed information about filters, dates, and coverage, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/wise.html"
target="_blank">the WISE webpage at IRSA <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and references linked
therein. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The dates for these images
as shown in Finder Chart  are the average date of the coadded frames.
Remember that these  images are coadds from individual frames taken at
different times. Near the ecliptic poles, these images may span
several months. The average date is also included in the FITS header.

<h4>SEIP</h4>

The Spitzer Space Telescope is a spacecraft with a pointed mission,
not an all-sky survey. However, much of the most popular regions of
the sky have Spitzer data. The Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (<a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/Enhanced/SEIP/overview.html"
target="_blank">SEIP <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>) combined all of the data taken during the
cryogenic era, made mosaics, and extracted a source list. There are
SEIP products for IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) and MIPS-24 (24
microns).  For more detailed information about filters, dates, and
coverage, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/spitzer.html"
target="_blank">the Spitzer webpage at IRSA <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and references linked
therein. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The dates for these images
are not shown in Finder Chart; these images are coadds from
individual frames taken at different times, possibly over years. The
average date is included in the FITS header.  <P>

<P>

<h4>AKARI</h4>

AKARI was a Japanese satellite that conducted an all-sky survey at
several bands between 1.8 and 180 microns. FIS was the long wavelength
instrument, with bands between 65 and 180 microns. For more detailed
information about filters, dates, and coverage, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/akari.html"
target="_blank">the AKARI webpage at IRSA <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A> and references linked
therein. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The dates for these images
are not shown in Finder Chart  because these images are coadds from
individual frames taken at different times. Near the ecliptic poles,
these images may span several months.  The average date is included in
the FITS header.  <P>

<tr><td>WIDE-L, or flux140</td><td>140 microns</td></tr>
<tr><td>N160, or flux160</td><td>160 microns</td></tr>
</table>
<P>

<h4>IRAS</h4>

The InfraRed Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) is a satellite that flew in
1983 and conducted an all-sky survey in 12, 25, 60, and 100 microns.
The angular resolution of the instrument varied between about 0.5
arcmin at 12 microns to about 2 arcmin at 100 microns. The original
images have been reprocessed into the IRAS Sky Survey Atlas (ISSA) and
IRIS (Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey). For more detailed
information about filters and coverage, see <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Missions/iras.html"

<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>

The words in blue rectangles at the top are 'tabs.'<br>
<img src="img/bluetabs.png"><P>

This (or something like it) is the <b>image toolbox</b>:<br> <img
src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br> The contents and location of
the image toolbox can change depending on what images you have loaded
and/or selected.  In IRSA Viewer, an image toolbox is always present
as a row of tools just under the IRSA banner.<P>

When you have images and catalogs loaded, your browser window is
divided into "panes", like "window panes." The contents of the panes
depends on what you are doing with the tool, but could include an
image pane, a catalog pane, and a plot pane.  You can expand any of
the window panes by clicking on the expand icon: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png"> <p>

When you add things to the image as seen in your browser, you are
adding 'layers' to your image. You can turn the various layers off and
on via the layers icon <img src="img/layers.png"> in the image toolbox
-- the circled number tells you how many layers are displayed for the
image you have shown or selected.<P>



<h3><A NAME="tools">Tools Overview</A></h3>

The only mechanism for searching in Finder Chart is searching by
position. One can submit a single target ("single position") or a list
of targets ("multiple positions"). (<a
href="basics.html#searching">More on searching</A>.)<P>


You can load in images from your local disk, from the web, or from
the IRSA archives. <a href="visualization.html">The Visualization section</A> covers basics of image manipulation. <P>

The <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A> covers basic table manipulations; the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A> covers aspects of the tool specific to catalogs, such as overlaying catalogs on images. <P>

The <a href="plots.html">Plots section</A> covers plots from catalogs you have loaded in.<P>

The images, catalogs, and plots are all interlinked such that clicking on one point in the plot highlights the same point in the catalog and the image.<P>




<h3><a name="download">Downloading Data Overview</A></h3>

There are two ways in which you can download the data.<P>

If you are looking at one object and just want to see all of these,
well, <em>finder charts</em> for this object in one place, click on
the "PDF" icon in the upper right. This will generate a PDF you can
save to your disk or print, just for the object you are currently
viewing. <strong>Note that</strong> if you select every possible
survey, you will have more than one page per object! If you are
preparing for an observing run and want to make PDFs for many targets,
do a few test targets first to make sure it does what you want it to
do. <P>

You can also download to disk the individual files in any of a variety
of file formats, or if you've searched on multiple targets, you can
save a PDF (if you have few enough images, it will be one object per
page). Click on  "Download" in the upper left of the images pane.  A
pop-up window asks if you would like to download data for just the
current target or all targets, whether you want FITS files, HTML, PDF,
or PNG files, and whether or not you want to be emailed when the
packaging is done. Click on "Prepare Download" to begin the packaging
and data download process -- the download then gets passed to a
background job for packaging.  See <a href="downloads.html">the
section on Downloads</A> or <a href="basics.html#background">the
section on the Background Monitor</A> for more information. <P>

<h3><a name="login">User Login Overview</A></h3>

In the far upper right, there is a link to log in.  Finder Chart can remember you when you return.  See the <a
href="user.html">user registration section</A> for more information. 
<P>

<h3><A NAME="help">Getting More Help</A></h3>


The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. There are also
context-sensitive help markers throughout the tools (<img
src="img/help.png">).  You can also download a PDF version of this
manual; look at the top of the help window. (The PDF may be easier to
search than the web pages; use your PDF reader's search function.) <P>
