<h2>Finder Chart: User Registration for the IRSA Archives</h2>

There is one user registration for all IRSA applications, but data
access, preferences, search history, data tagging, etc., are all
unique to each archive.<P>

While you certainly <b>do not have to register</b> to search the
archive, download data, analyze data, and write a paper, you may wish
to register. <P>

Finder Chart does not access proprietary data, so there is no strong
motivation to register in order to use Finder Chart.<P>

On the other hand, <strong><em>if you are trying to gain access to
your proprietary data in a particular archive (other than
Finder Chart), you will need to log in</em></strong> so that the system
grants you access to your data. Not all archives served by IRSA have
proprietary data.  If you got email from an archive's Help Desk about
account information, you may already have an account; else you can set
up an account (see below).  Once you have set up an account, please
send us an email at the IRSA Help Desk and we'll tie your new account
to your proprietary data.  <P>
