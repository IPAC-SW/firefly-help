<h2>Finder Chart: Basic Features and Functions </h2>


This section is an overview of the basic features and functions of
Finder Chart. The contents essentially follow the menu
options (e.g., basically the blue tabs across the top, under the IRSA
menu).<br> <img src="img/bluetabs.png" width="100%"><P>

Besides the online help (also available as a PDF), there are also
Finder Chart video tutorials, available at the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>. There is a playlist that
collects together all of the  Finder Chart videos. Also see the list
of "micro-tutorials" relevant for more than one tool, and the list of
tutorials using more than one tool.<P>

<H3><A NAME="searching">How to Search</A></H3>

Searching in Finder Chart is straightforward -- search by position for
a cone search. <P>

<img src="img/searchscreen.png" width="100%"><P>

<strong>Name or position</strong>. By default, it assumes you are
searching on a single target. You may enter a target name, and have
either NED-then-Simbad or Simbad-then-NED resolve the target name into
coordinates.  Alternatively, you may enter coordinates directly. These
coordinates can be in decimal degrees or in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.
By default, it assumes you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can
also specify galactic, ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>
Examples are given below the text entry box before you start typing in
the box.<P>

As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, Finder Chart echoes
back to you what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box
in which you are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change. 
<P>

<strong>Image Size</strong>. After the position entry information, you
can specify the image size you want to retrieve; the default is 300
arcseconds. You may enter the radius in arcseconds, arcminutes, or
degrees; just change the pulldown option accordingly.
<strong>Caution:</strong> pick your units from the pulldown first, and
then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from the
pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to the new
units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search radius;
Finder Chart will tell you if you request something too big (&gt; 1
degree) or too small (&lt; 1 arcsec). <P>

<strong>Display Size</strong>. The "Display Size" indicates whether
you want small, medium, or large thumbnails.  This feature is useful
if you are working on a small laptop screen vs. a large desktop
monitor. "Small" thumbnails are 128 screen pixels across, "medium"
thumbnails are 192 screen pixels across, and "large" thumbnails are
256 screen pixels across. The angular width (on a side) of each of the
thumbnails will be what you have requested above.<P>

<strong>Select Images</strong>. Next, you can select which image sets
you would like to retrieve. The  choices are DSS, SDSS (data release,
DR, 7), 2MASS (the all-sky catalog and images), WISE (the AllWISE
images and catalog), SEIP (reprocessing of the cryo Spitzer data),
AKARI (FIS only), and IRAS (the IRIS catalog and images). By default,
it searches for all available bands for each of the surveys you
select; you can select only particular bands; see "image search
options" below, or see the <a href="overview.html#surveys">Overview
section</A> for a list of available surveys and bands. <P>

<strong>Search Corresponding Catalog(s)</strong>. You can ask it to
search the catalogs corresponding to those images for SDSS, 2MASS,
WISE, SEIP, AKARI, and/or IRAS. (Details of table manipulation are in the <a href="tables.html">Tables section</A>; specific application of those properties to catalogs are in the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs section</A>.) <P>

If you have set "Search Corresponding Catalog(s)" to "yes", then you
will have an additional set of lines appear that correspond to options
for searching the catalogs. You can ask it to find all the sources in
the corresponding catalogs within the image boundary (could be over a
large region, depending on your image size), or just within a certain
search radius. If you select "search radius", additional boxes appear
for each survey you have selected that specifies the search radius to
use (in arcseconds) for each survey. Default values for IRAS are much
larger than the default values of the other surveys because of the
difference in spatial resolution. There is an additional option, "One
to One Match." This is a powerful option -- when this option is
selected, it will find just the closest source to your position within
your selected search radius, and <em>only</em> that closest source.<P>

<strong>Image Search Options</strong>. Under "Image Search Options"
(click on the black triangle to reveal these options), you can turn on
or off individual channels within the image search -- for example, if
you just want the DSS2 images, or just the WISE-4 image.<P>

The search window can be retrieved after a search by clicking on the
blue "Searches" tab near the top left.<P>




<h3><A NAME="byTable">Searching on multiple targets -- Batch mode</A></h3>
    
The position search can also be executed in "batch mode" for a list of
objects given in a file -- select the "Multiple Positions" tab from the search
page.  <P> 

You can load a file from your local disk or the <a
href="/docs/workspace/" target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.

The file can be in any of three formats: comma-separated values
(CSV), tab-separated values (TSV), or <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, which is basically ASCII text
with headers explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by
vertical bars.  

The simplest possible input file looks like this example: <P>
<pre>

|              ra|              dec|
|          double|           double|
|             deg|              deg|

 262.341432853080 -23.7518928284717
 271.202769466020 -21.7274227022229
 291.167629785682 -29.2569222675305
 272.336516119634 -20.2761650442889
 237.391628608612   2.5906013137112
</pre><P>

Please use the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank"> IPAC table check tool <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></a> to check and reformat your
input table before the table upload. <P>

<strong>Note:</strong> Your uploaded table must have RA and Dec, not
just target names.<P>


<strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If the table upload search still
does not work properly, try the following :<p> 
<UL> 
<LI> No hyphens allowed in column names, or in the filename!
(Sometimes this seems to matter, or matter only for some things and
not others, and sometimes it doesn't. If you are getting weird
behavior, this is one thing to try.)
<LI> Column names should be all in lower case.
<LI> No spaces after the last pipes in the header lines.
<LI> No empty lines at the end of the input file. 
</UL>
<p>


After your search, your input table will appear as part of your
results. If you wish to have a name (not just coordinates and row
number) displayed for each of your objects, add a column to your input
file called "objname" that contains the name of the object. (NB: that
name should just be letters and numbers -- no parentheses or brackets,
etc.)<P>

<em><strong>One to One Match</strong></em>: On the search screen, if
you select "Search Corresponding Catalog(s)", and then go to "Catalog
Search Options", there is an additional option called "One to One
Match." This is a very powerful option, particularly for a list of
targets. When this option is selected, it will find just the closest
source to your position within your selected search radius, and
<em>only</em> that closest source.  The resultant catalog has
one line per input source; if no counterpart is found, then the
corresponding line indicates that no source was found.<P>






<A NAME="catalogs"><H3>Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</H3></A>

You can search for SDSS, 2MASS, WISE, SEIP, AKARI, and/or IRAS
catalogs directly from the front page of Finder Chart. Additionally,
from the blue "catalogs" tab at the top of the page, you can choose
from any of a wide variety of <a href="catalogs.html">catalogs</A>
(from IRSA, your own disk or the <a href="/docs/workspace/"
target="_blank">IRSA Workspace <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>, the VO, or NED) to load and
overlay on your <a href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. You
can also make <a href="plots.html">plots from the
catalogs</A>, either those retrieved via the front page, or after a
separate search.<P>


For more information on catalogs, please see the <a href="tables.html">Tables</A> and <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs</A>
sections.<P>



<h3><A NAME="help">Getting More Help</A></h3>


The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. There are also
context-sensitive help markers throughout the tools (<img
src="img/help.png">).  You can also download a PDF version of this
manual; look at the top of the help window. (The PDF may be easier to
search than the web pages; use your PDF reader's search function.) <P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk/"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.<P>

A set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about Finder Chart is <a

<a name="bugs"></A><strong>Found a bug?</strong> The known bugs and
issues in this version of Finder Chart are listed <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/irsaviewerbugslist.html"
target="_blank">here <img src="img/jumpout.jpg" height="10"></A>.  If
you think you have found a bug, before reporting it, please check this
list, and read this online Finder Chart help. It may be a "feature" we
already know about.  If you have found a new, real bug, then please do
contact us via the <a
href="https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></A>. Please include your operating system version and
your browser software and version.  If you can, please also include
any specific error message you may have gotten. (NB: In our testing,
copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux; the command-C did not
work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the right mouse button
did.)<P>




<A NAME="downloads"><H3>Downloads - Downloading data</H3></A>

On any search results page, click "Download" (near the top left of the
window) to begin the packaging and downloading process.  A pop-up
window will appear in order to define exactly what kinds of data you
would like to have packaged up.  <P>

The packaging process spins off into the <a
href="#background">background monitor</A>, which keeps track of its
progress and notifies you when the downloads are complete. You can
choose to have an email sent to you to let you know when things are
ready, even after the packaging process has started. If you have just
a few zip files, you can click to download them, but especially if you
have many files, you may want to have Finder Chart generate a <a
href="downloads.html#downloadScript">downloading script</A> for you to
download them all automatically. <P>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. Look for a
"Downloads" folder or search for recently modified files. <P>

For more information, please see the <a
href="downloads.html">Downloads section</A>.<P>




<a NAME="background"><h3>The Background Monitor</h3></A>

The Background Monitor appears as a blue tab in the upper
right of your window to keep track of the data downloads you have
requested.  It actively changes to reflect what it is doing
("Preparing", etc., e.g.,: <img src="img/preparing.png">) Data
packaging all goes to the Background Monitor; larger catalog requests
are also sent to the Background Monitor.  It also (optionally)
provides a <a href="downloads.html#downloadScript">download script</A>
if you have more than one package to download.<P>

A pop-up window can be called up at any time by clicking the
"Background Monitor" tab.  For example, you can watch your catalog
being retrieved. It will update that window when the data are
available for download and overlay on your image, providing a link for
obtaining the data. It also keeps track of the downloads you have
requested during the same session, and indicates with a checkmark
those that you have already loaded. Remove them from the list by
clicking on the 'x' on the far right. <br> <img
src="img/backgroundpopup.png"><img src="img/backgroundpopup2.png"><P>

To stop any query mid-way through, click on the little red octagon
("stop sign") that appears next to the query in the Background Monitor
pop-up.<P>

When packaging up data, if you forgot to put in your email at the
beginning (for example, in the case of the packaging turning out to
take longer than you expected), you can ask it to let you know when it
is done. Click on the "enable email notification" tickbox and add your
email, even during the packaging process. It will send you an email
when it is done. <P>
