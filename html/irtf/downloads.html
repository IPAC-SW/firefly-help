<h2>IRTF Archive: Downloads</h2>


To select data for download, click on the checkbox on the far left of
the data table, or click on the box at the top of that column to
select every row. <p>

By default, related data are automatically packaged together with data
downloads from the NASA IRTF archive. <em>Caution:</em> packaged data can
be very large files, and may take a long time to package and
download. You can choose what to include:
</p><dl>
<dt><strong>Selected Data</strong>
</dt><dd> The data you have selected is, of course, included. 
To select observations, click on the checkbox to the left of the rows
you wish to download; click on the checkbox at the top of the column
of checkboxes to select all observations.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Related Standard Groups</strong> 
</dt><dd> Include standards obtained near the observation of interest and related to it.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Related Calibration Groups</strong> 
</dt><dd> Include calibration frames related to the observation of interest.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>IE Logs</strong> 
</dt><dd> Include instrumenation logs. This file includes key events logged
by the TCS and instruments to document sequences of events during
observing to help understand the archived data.  <p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Weather data</strong> 
</dt><dd> Include weather data.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Program information</strong> 
</dt><dd> Include information about the program that obtained the observation of interest.<p>

</p></dd></dl>

You can also choose to have the observations sorted into directories.
(See the "Organize downloads into directories" checkbox.) If this box
is not checked, the data will unzip into a flight directory structure
(e.g., no subdirectories). If this box is checked, the data will unzip
into a multiply-nested set of subdirectories, e.g.,
2016B/20160803/data/2016B048/sbd_20160803_151141.  If you download
only one or two observations, this structure may seem funny; it makes
more sense if you are downloading many observations. In any case, you
can rearrange the data organization once you download the data. <p>

Click on the 'download' button to download your data. </p><p>

Note that <b>you</b> control where the data are saved on your disk
through your browser; your browser may be configured to store all
downloads in a particular location on your disk. Look for a
"Downloads" folder or search for recently modified files. </p><p>

<dt><strong>UnzipTroubleshooting</strong>  
</dt><dd>If you have an old computer and/or
an old OS, and if you download more than one observation at a time,
then you may very well get a zip file you cannot unpack. It complains
that it is corrupted :
<pre>warning [IRTF.zip]: 4098391235 extra bytes at beginning or within zipfile
(attempting to process anyway)
error [IRTF.zip]: start of central directory not found;
zipfile corrupt.
(please check that you have transferred or created the zipfile in the
appropriate BINARY mode and that you have compiled UnZip properly)</pre> 
This is because the zip files are bigger than a threshold (likely 4 GB
for your machine). If you have a recent version of the unzip software,
it should just work and you will never notice. If you have an only
sort of old version, you can try to "repair" the file (use "zip -F
IRTF.zip --out IRTF2.zip" and then "unzip IRTF2.zip"). If that still
doesn't work for you, you can update the unzip software. On a Mac, if
you use Homebrew, type "brew install unzip". Homebrew will get the
software but then express reluctance to install it for you, making it
seem like you are doing something terribly risky in updating the
software. So, you should invoke it using the full path
/usr/local/opt/unzip/bin/unzip rather than via an unqualified unzip.
If you are not comfortable doing that, the workaround is to download
one observation at a time (one row from the GUI), and unzip them from
the command line (as opposed to double-clicking on the zip file) --
then it will nest all of the files properly, as if you had downloaded
just one big zip file. <p>
