<h2>IRTF Archive: Searching</h2>



There are several ways to search the NASA IRTF Archive, which
we now describe.
<dl>
<dt><strong>Cone searches with a specified radius</strong>
</dt><dd> Specify a target by name or position in a variety of units
(RA/Dec, Galactic, ecliptic) or a table of coordinates (in csv format
or in <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table file <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></a> format; use the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">IPAC table validator <img src="img/jumpout.jpg"
height="10"></a> to check and reformat your input table before
uploading.) By default, the cone search radius is a degree; this value
must be between 1 and 5 deg. Optionally, you can also constrain the
date range, the program ID, the instrument, and the observing
conditions. Note that searches by date range are inclusive of the
minimum date and exclusive of the maximum date.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>All-sky searches by date or program ID.</strong>
</dt><dd> Specify a date range or a program ID, and search over the whole
sky. <strong>This is the easiest way to download all the data
associated with a given program.</strong> Optionally, you can
also constrain the date range, the program ID, the instrument, and the
observing conditions.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Solar System objects (moving targets) by name or NAIF ID.</strong>
</dt><dd> Specify the object name or its NAIF ID. Optionally, you can
also constrain the date range, the program ID, the instrument, and the
observing conditions.<p>

</p></dd><dt><strong>Precovery searches by name or NAIF ID or orbital parameters.</strong>
</dt><dd> This search looks for serendipitous observations of a Solar System target.
Specify the object name or its NAIF ID, <em>OR</em> the MPC 1-line
input, <em>OR</em> manually specify the orbital parameters. It does
the calculation to figure where the object is as a function of time,
and looks for data covering the object. Optionally, you can also
constrain the date range, the program ID, the instrument, and the
observing conditions. This calculation can take a long time; use long
time baselines with caution. <p>
</p></dd></dl>

You can additionally constrain:<p>

<strong>Instruments</strong>: At this time, the instruments that are
available are the SpeX spectrograph and guider, and the iSHELL
spectrograph and guider/imager. </p><p>
